# QuantaMind — Codebase Documentation

> A native desktop workbench for running, comparing, and managing local large
> language models. Tauri 2.x + Rust backend + React 18 / TypeScript frontend.
> Local-first, no telemetry, ~30 MB binary.

This folder is the **deep, file-by-file reference** for the entire codebase.
Every page answers three questions for each module, folder, and file:

- **Why** it exists (the problem it solves / the rule it enforces)
- **What** it is (the types, functions, exports, contracts)
- **How / Where** it is used (who calls it, which feature/tab/page it powers)

For the higher-level narrative (engineering principles, install pipeline,
feature tours) see the root [`README.md`](../../README.md). For the binding
rules see [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) and the three engineering docs:
[`architecture.md`](../architecture.md), [`process.md`](../process.md),
[`reference.md`](../reference.md).

## How to read this folder

The code splits cleanly into two halves connected by **Tauri IPC** (the
frontend calls Rust `#[tauri::command]` functions through a typed client; Rust
streams events back). Start with the two overview pages, then jump to the
subsystem you care about.

```
React UI  ──(invoke "command_name", args)──▶  Rust #[tauri::command]
   ▲                                                  │
   └──────────(emit "event_name", payload)◀───────────┘
```

## The top-level navigation (what the user sees)

`frontend/src/App.tsx` renders ten top-nav tabs (`TABS` array). Each maps to one
page component and one documentation page above:

| Tab (`TopView` id) | Page component | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| `workspace` | `features/workspace/components/Workspace.tsx` | [frontend-workspace](frontend-workspace.md) |
| `compare` ("Analysis") | `features/compare/components/AnalysisPage.tsx` | [frontend-compare-analysis](frontend-compare-analysis.md) |
| `inspector` | `features/inspector/components/InspectorPage.tsx` | [frontend-inspector-quant-agentreport](frontend-inspector-quant-agentreport.md) |
| `eval` | `features/eval/components/EvalPage.tsx` | [frontend-eval](frontend-eval.md) |
| `audit` | `features/audit/components/AuditPage.tsx` | [frontend-support-features](frontend-support-features.md) |
| `agentReport` | `features/agentReport/components/AgentReportPage.tsx` | [frontend-inspector-quant-agentreport](frontend-inspector-quant-agentreport.md) |
| `models` | `features/models/components/ModelsPage.tsx` | [frontend-models](frontend-models.md) |
| `downloads` | `features/models/components/DownloadsPage.tsx` | [frontend-models](frontend-models.md) |
| `settings` | `features/settings/components/SettingsPage.tsx` | [frontend-support-features](frontend-support-features.md) |
| `help` | `features/help/components/HelpPage.tsx` | [frontend-support-features](frontend-support-features.md) |

The Quant view is a **sub-tab merged into Analysis** (see commit history); it is
documented alongside Inspector/Agent Report because it shares the readiness
data model.

## The backend command surface (the IPC contract)

`backend/src/lib.rs` is the single registration point. Its `tauri::Builder`:

1. Registers Tauri plugins (`dialog`, `process`, `shell`, `updater`).
2. `.manage(...)`s 17 pieces of shared mutable state (run cancellation tokens,
   install trackers, server handles, auth state).
3. `.setup(...)` reclaims orphaned sidecar servers, installs a signal reaper,
   reconciles half-installed STT artifacts, and clears recording scratch.
4. `.invoke_handler(generate_handler![...])` exposes ~120 commands.
5. `.run(reap_on_exit)` guarantees child servers die with the app.

Every command in that list is documented on the backend page for its subsystem.
The managed-state structs and the lifecycle hooks are documented in
[backend-overview.md](backend-overview.md).

## Conventions used in these docs

- **File** headers are repo-relative paths, clickable as `path:line` where a
  specific line is cited.
- Code snippets are **real excerpts** (possibly trimmed with `…`) — they show
  the actual signature/shape, not pseudocode.
- "Sink" = a thin object that owns side effects (event emit, disk write) so the
  pure runner stays testable. See [architecture.md#layering](../architecture.md).
- Test files (`*_tests.rs`, `*.test.tsx`) are noted next to the unit they cover
  rather than given their own sections.
