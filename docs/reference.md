# Reference

The bench/analysis document contract and the error-state troubleshooting
help (whose anchors back the in-app "Learn more" links). Companion docs:
`architecture.md` and `process.md`.

## Analysis schema

The bench/analysis document contract (v1). `frontend/src/features/compare/format/
schema.ts` exports a populated subset of this shape; keep the two in sync.

### Status

The export (`buildReport.ts`) emits this format as a **populated subset**:
`document_type:"bench-report"`, `schema_version:"1.0.0"`, with
`environment`/`models`/`prompts`/`runs`/`reproducibility` filled from whatever
data we currently have and every other field omitted (the schema keeps them
optional). `findings`/`verdicts` stay empty for app-generated reports. The
remaining gaps (CPU/OS/GPU detail, per-run parameters, `parameter_count`,
`author`/provenance, ULID monotonicity) fill in as the app gains that data.

### What this schema is

One schema covers two artifacts, the report being a special case of the analysis:

- **Bench report** (`document_type: "bench-report"`) — "I ran prompt X against
  models A, B, C on my hardware; here are outputs + metrics." `runs` filled,
  `findings`/`verdicts` empty. This is what the exporter generates.
- **Community analysis** (`document_type: "analysis"`) — a broader investigation:
  many prompts, many models, narrative + opinions. Fills `findings`/`verdicts`.

Same schema so a bench report can be reshared as a building block of a bigger
analysis, and submissions can be aggregated.

### Design principles

- **Versioned from day one** — every document declares `schema_version` (semver,
  e.g. `"1.0.0"`) so future parsers branch cleanly.
- **Hardware + software environment are first-class** — a metric without an
  environment is unfalsifiable. `environment` is required.
- **Outputs denormalized with their prompts** — a fork that edits one prompt
  stays internally consistent.
- **Metrics are nullable** — `null` = "not measured" (distinct from `0`); cloud
  models have no local VRAM, some backends don't expose KV-cache size.
- **Provenance optional in v1** — `author`/signature/submitted-at must not block
  app-generated reports without a signed-in identity.
- **Verdicts/observations separate from raw data** — opinions live in structured
  `findings`/`verdicts`, never mixed into `runs`.
- **Reproducibility included even when imperfect** — recording seed/temperature/
  params makes "I couldn't reproduce" debuggable.
- **IDs are ULIDs** (`document_id`, `run.id`) — time-sortable, unlike UUIDs.
- **Model id convention** `model.{family}_{params}.{quant}`; `source.digest`
  (SHA256) disambiguates same-name/different-weights collisions.
- **Outputs verbatim** — `output.text` is complete, not truncated/normalized.
- **Multi-dimensional 1–5 verdict scores**, not one fake-precise overall number;
  consumers must tolerate unknown score keys (dimensions can grow).

### Field overview

Top-level object (required fields per the JSON Schema marked **R**):

| Field | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` **R** | string | semver `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` |
| `document_id` **R** | string | 26-char ULID |
| `document_type` **R** | enum | `bench-report` \| `analysis` |
| `title` **R** | string | 1–200 chars |
| `summary` | string | |
| `created_at` **R** / `updated_at` | date-time | ISO 8601 |
| `author` | object | `name`, `handle`, `url`, `verified` |
| `license` / `tags` | string / string[] | |
| `environment` **R** | object | `os`, `cpu`, `gpu`, `memory`, `quantamind`, `runtimes[]` |
| `models` **R** | array (≥1) | `id`, `name`, `family`, `parameter_count`, `quantization`, `size_bytes`, `source{type,registry,digest}`, `backend`, `context_length`, `chat_template` |
| `prompts` **R** | array (≥1) | `id`, `name`, `category`, `system_prompt`, `user_prompt`, `expected_behavior`, `evaluation_criteria[]` |
| `runs` **R** | array (≥1) | `id`, `prompt_id`, `model_id`, `started_at`/`completed_at`, `status`, `parameters{}`, `metrics{}`, `output{text,stop_reason,truncated}`, `warnings[]`, `errors[]` |
| `findings` | array | `id`, `type`, `severity`, `related_model_ids[]`, `related_run_ids[]`, `title`, `description`, `evidence` |
| `verdicts` | array | `model_id`, `recommendation`, `reasoning`, `scores{1–5 per dimension}` |
| `reproducibility` | object | `deterministic`, `seed_strategy`, `notes` |
| `links` | object | `blog_post`, `github_discussion`, `raw_outputs_archive` |

`run.metrics`: `ttft_ms`, `tokens_per_second`, `total_tokens_generated`,
`total_prompt_tokens`, `wall_clock_ms`, `prompt_eval_ms`,
`prompt_eval_tokens_per_second`, `vram_allocated_bytes`, `kv_cache_bytes`,
`peak_resident_memory_bytes` — all nullable (`null` = not measured).

### Format notes that matter more than the field list

- **ULIDs, not UUIDs** for `document_id`/`run.id` — time-sortable storage.
- **`null` vs `0` in `metrics`** — tooling renders "not available", never "0 MB".
- **`output.text` is verbatim and complete** — no truncation/whitespace
  stripping/unicode normalization. If too large, paginate or compress — never
  lossy-encode the model's speech.
- **`findings`/`verdicts` are optional and separate** — a raw bench report emits
  `runs` only; an analysis fills the rest.
- **`reproducibility` is first-class** — honest info (even "not deterministic,
  here's why") is what makes a submission trustworthy.
- **`verdicts.scores` are 1–5 per dimension**, never one overall number.

### Deliberately left out (add only in a future schema version)

No token-level data / log-probs / embeddings (100× larger). No automatic quality
scoring (BLEU etc.) — quality is human-judged in `verdicts`. No document-level
"winner" — let consumers aggregate `verdicts`. No social metadata
(views/upvotes/comments) — those belong in a community platform's DB.

### Where this lives in the product

- **Export report** — target emitter for `bench-report` (`runs` filled, no
  findings/verdicts). The Markdown export is the human-readable view derived from
  this JSON.
- **QuantaMind reads this format** — display old reports, compare two, import
  shared analyses. Saved bench configurations fit as `bench-report`s.
- **Community platform (far future)** — accepts uploads, validates against the
  JSON Schema, displays/searches by tags/models/hardware. Do not build a
  submission flow until community demand pulls for it.

## Global selection: backend, model, params {#global-selection}

The top header carries three app-wide choices, surfaced on every view so it's
always clear what you're running and how:

- **Backend** (`backendStore`) — Ollama / llama.cpp / MLX. The model list is
  filtered to the selected backend; switching backend trims a now-incompatible
  model selection (a model is bound to its backend's weight format).
- **Model** (`selectedModelStore`) — the global selection (an array).
  **Ollama is multi-select** (1 → a single run in the Workspace; 2+ → a
  sequential/parallel compare shown in the Workspace, results on Analysis);
  **llama.cpp/MLX are single-select**. Every page reads this — there is no
  per-page model picker. Analysis is results-only; Eval has its own *target*
  multi-select but it is filtered to the selected backend; the Audit
  Context-Cliff probe runs one global model (a dropdown picks which when 2+
  Ollama models are selected).

The llama.cpp path posts to the native `/completion`; if that route 404s (a build
that lacks it, or another OpenAI-style server answering on the same port — e.g.
`mlx_lm.server`, whose default port is also 8080), it falls back to the
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` so the run still works.
- **Inference params** (`paramsStore`) — temperature, top_p, top_k, max_tokens,
  repeat_penalty, seed. **The single source of truth for every run** — Workspace,
  Analysis compare, Eval batch, and the Context-Cliff probe all read
  `globalParams`. A field left unset is omitted so the backend default applies;
  ranges are validated at the Rust boundary (`commands/prompt/prompt_options.rs`).
  With **2+ Ollama models**, a "use the same parameters for all" toggle switches
  to per-model overrides (`perModelParams`).
- **Keep model loaded** (`paramsStore.keepLoaded`, default off) — off unloads the
  model after each run (Ollama `keep_alive=0`); on keeps it resident
  (`keep_alive=-1`). Ollama-only; llama.cpp/MLX keep their model while the sidecar
  runs.

Prompt files (`*.quantamind.yaml`) no longer store params. An older file that
still carries a `params:` block loads fine (it is ignored and stripped on the
next save). Restoring a run from History puts its params back into the header.
The per-model saved temperature (`model_settings.yaml`) remains a last-resort
fallback, used only when the global temperature is unset.

## Troubleshooting

Error states in QuantaMind aim to tell you *what* broke and *what to do next*.
Every run-path error renders an `ErrorCard` (title + helpful body + a primary
action + a "Learn more" link to the relevant section here). Error copy is
classified in `frontend/src/shared/ipc/core/errorInfo.ts`; the card lives in
`frontend/src/shared/ui/ErrorCard.tsx`. The anchors below match the `learnMore`
links the classifier emits (mirrored at `quantamind.co/docs/troubleshooting`).

### Ollama not running {#ollama-not-running}

QuantaMind talks to a local Ollama server at `localhost:11434`. If it isn't
running you'll see "Ollama isn't running".

- Click **Start Ollama** in the model picker's empty state (macOS), or run
  `ollama serve` in a terminal.
- Confirm it's up: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags` should return JSON.
- On Windows/Linux, launch the Ollama app/service manually — in-app start is
  macOS-only in this release.

### Backend server down — batch pre-flight {#batch-preflight}

Every backend's server health is polled into the header dots every 5s — Ollama, MLX,
and (new) **llama.cpp** (`check_llama_health`); a dot that was green goes grey within
~5s of the server dying, so the indicator never lies. An Eval **batch run pre-flights
every backend it targets** before starting: if any selected backend's server isn't
reachable it aborts immediately with *"&lt;Backend&gt; server isn't reachable — start it
from the Workspace status bar, then re-run"* — instead of hanging mid-run. Start the
named server from the header, then re-run.

### Model not installed {#model-not-found}

"That model isn't installed" means Ollama doesn't have the model you asked to
run.

- Open the **Models** tab and pull it (Ollama library, HuggingFace, or a local
  GGUF).
- Names are exact, including the tag: `llama3.2:1b`, not `llama3.2`.

### Duplicate models in the picker {#duplicate-models}

If the same model was imported into Ollama under more than one tag (e.g. a local
GGUF added as both `mymodel_q3_k_l:latest` and `mymodel:q3_k_l`), Ollama's
`/api/tags` lists each tag separately. They point to the same blob and share one
`digest`, so the **model picker collapses them to a single entry** (first tag
wins). The **Models → Storage** view still lists every tag so you can delete the
redundant one. Different quantizations (`Q3_K_L` vs `Q2_K`) have different
digests and remain distinct — they are not duplicates.

### Out of memory {#out-of-memory}

"Not enough memory for this model" means it didn't fit in available RAM/VRAM.

- Pick a smaller parameter size (1B/3B instead of 7B/13B) or a more aggressive
  quantization (Q4 instead of Q8) in the Models tab.
- Close other memory-heavy apps.
- In Compare, prefer the sequential strategy so only one model loads at a time.

### Timeouts {#timeouts}

"The request timed out" usually means a large model is still loading its weights
on first use.

- Wait a few seconds and click **Retry** — first load of a multi-GB model can
  take 10–30s.
- If it persists, the model may be too large for this machine; see
  [out of memory](#out-of-memory).

### MLX not detected {#mlx-not-detected}

The **MLX** backend appears in the workspace rail only on Apple Silicon. Install
mlx-lm once into a virtual env (`python3 -m venv ~/mlx-env`,
`source ~/mlx-env/bin/activate`, `pip install -U mlx-lm`) — the in-app backend
setup guide shows these three copy-able commands. MLX models then work like every
other backend: **download → select → Start → run/eval/quant.**

**Download:** in **Models → HuggingFace**, flip the **GGUF / MLX** toggle to MLX
and search. Each toggle filters search to that library tag — GGUF to `gguf`-tagged
repos (so only repos with downloadable `.gguf` files appear; speech/audio GGUFs
like whisper are dropped since they can't run as an LLM), MLX to `mlx`-tagged
repos, mostly `mlx-community`. Open a repo and click **Download for MLX** — the
full snapshot (config + safetensors + tokenizer) lands in `~/.quantamind/mlx/`
(override with `QUANTAMIND_MLX_DIR`). The **detail view follows the repo's tags,
not the toggle**, so an `mlx`-tagged repo opens the MLX download even when found
under GGUF search.

**Select + run:** the downloaded model appears in the Workspace dropdown
(labelled by its HF repo) as soon as it's downloaded — no running server needed.
Pick it, press **Start MLX** (the header launches `mlx_lm.server --model <local
dir>`; "Starting…" while it loads), and once green run prompts / eval / quant
like any backend. One model loads at a time; pick another and Start to switch.

**Guardrail — text-generation only.** `mlx_lm.server` serves text-generation
LLMs; a text-to-speech / embedding / vision repo would download gigabytes and
then never answer a chat request. So **Download for MLX** checks the repo's task
and, if it isn't `text-generation`, shows a blocking dialog ("This model won't
run on MLX") with a *Pick another* / *Download anyway* choice.

- **"mlx_lm.server not found"** — QuantaMind searches `PATH` and common venvs
  (`~/mlx-env/bin`, `~/.venv/bin`, Homebrew, conda). If yours is elsewhere, set
  `QUANTAMIND_MLX_SERVER` to its full path and restart.
- **"Port 8082 in use" / "no free port"** — it auto-picks a free port in
  8082–8092; only if all are taken does it fail. Free one and retry.
- **It exited** — the error shows the server's stderr tail (e.g. a missing
  Python dep). Fix it in your venv and Start again.
- **Model not in the dropdown?** The picker lists what's been downloaded into
  the MLX folder; download it from the HuggingFace tab first. (A model loaded by
  a manually-run `mlx_lm.server` won't appear — discovery is disk-based now.)
- **Reproducibility note:** mlx_lm.server has no seed parameter, so MLX runs are
  not seed-reproducible the way Ollama and llama.cpp runs are — a fixed seed in
  the params is ignored for MLX.

### Invalid or truncated GGUF {#invalid-gguf}

Adding a local `.gguf` parses it in Rust first (`inference/gguf/`). A bad file no
longer shows the raw parser line (e.g. *"GGUF truncated: need 8 bytes at offset …"*);
the **Models → Local file** tab renders plain-language guidance with steps instead, so
it reads as fixable, not broken. The classifier (`ImportError` in
`features/models/components/LocalFilePreview.tsx`) covers three cases:

- **"This GGUF file is incomplete"** (truncated / file-too-small) — the download or copy
  was cut off; it isn't the full model. Re-download the complete `.gguf`. Real models are
  hundreds of MB to several GB; a tiny file is truncated. From Hugging Face, fetch the
  real `.gguf` via **Git LFS**, not a small pointer stub. Note: the parser grows its
  metadata read window on demand (up to 256 MiB), so a large-vocab tokenizer (e.g. Qwen3)
  no longer trips this — a truncation error now means the file really is incomplete.
- **"This isn't a valid GGUF file"** (bad magic / wrong extension) — pick a `.gguf`, not
  `.safetensors`, `.bin`, or a zip.
- **"Unsupported GGUF version"** — QuantaMind reads GGUF v1–v3; get a compatible export.

The raw parser detail is kept (demoted) under **Details:** for diagnosis.

### Setting up speech-to-text (whisper.cpp) {#stt-server}

STT runs on **whisper.cpp**, its own axis parallel to the LLM backend — one STT
runs alongside one LLM. Install it (`brew install whisper-cpp`), download a model
in Models → Speech-to-Text, then pick it in the header STT group and press ▶. See
below for details.

The whisper.cpp engine. On macOS, install it once with Homebrew — the
**Speech-to-Text** tab walks you through it:

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it.
2. Run `brew install whisper-cpp` (the tab has a copy button).
3. Click **Re-check** — QuantaMind finds it automatically on `PATH`/Homebrew
   (`check_whisper_env`); no path setup needed. Installed it elsewhere? Use
   **Choose its folder** (remembered across launches).

If the tab says **"installed but can't run"**, the binary is present but its
libraries are missing/mismatched (a dyld *Library not loaded* error, shown under
Details) — run `brew reinstall whisper-cpp` and Re-check. QuantaMind only signals
ready after a `--help` dry-run proves the engine actually executes, so it never
shows "ready" then fails on start.

Once the engine is ready, the catalog lists models with their download size;
installed models (validated ggml + the shared silero VAD) are reported by
`list_installed_stt_models`. A download shows in the **Downloads** page too —
live progress in the active list, then an **STT** tag in the installed list
(Delete removes the model's `.bin`, keeping the shared VAD).

**Start failures** (`start_whisper_server`) return a tagged result so the UI says
exactly what to fix — none mean the app is broken:

- **`not_bundled`** — no `whisper-server` was found. Install whisper.cpp (above).
- **`model_missing`** — the whisper model file isn't on disk. Download a model
  from the STT catalog first.
- **`vad_missing`** — the silero VAD model is absent. The VAD ships *together*
  with each whisper model, so re-run the download; STT stays disabled without it
  (the VAD gates the silence-detection metric).
- **`port_conflict`** — something else holds the STT port (`:8093`). QuantaMind
  won't take over a process it didn't start — stop the other process and retry.
- **"Can't reach the local STT server"** — the server isn't answering on
  `127.0.0.1`. STT is offline-only; it never reaches the cloud, so a down local
  server fails loud rather than silently falling back.

### Clearing cached data {#clear-cache}

Downloads → **Clear cache** reclaims space taken by regenerable app data. It
asks you to type `CLEAR` first, then deletes: eval regression history, the last
batch reports, resumable job logs, pipeline-visualizer traces, context-cliff
measurements, and the recent-workspace list. It reports how much was freed.

**Kept, always:** your downloaded models, custom eval collections, readiness
profiles, and app/model settings. The disk-usage number counts only model files,
so it won't change after a clear — the freed amount is shown separately.

### Reporting something else

Use the in-app **Feedback** button (bottom-right). Tick "Include diagnostic info"
so we get your app version, OS, and current model.

## Tool-calling eval {#toolcall-eval}

The **Eval** tab's tool-calling test measures whether a model can reliably drive
an agent — entirely offline and deterministic. Read the scores with these caveats:

- **Prompt-based, not native function-calling.** The tool schemas are injected
  into the system prompt and the JSON call is parsed from the completion text.
  This is backend-agnostic (identical on Ollama / llama.cpp / MLX) and mirrors
  how many local-agent builders work — but the numbers are **not comparable to
  BFCL / native-FC leaderboards** (which use a `tools` field + native
  `tool_calls`). Treat them as a within-app, like-for-like comparison.
- **Structural scoring, not execution.** A call is judged by matching the tool
  **name + arguments structurally** (BFCL's validated proxy), never by running
  the function. So scores reflect *format + selection correctness*, not runtime
  success. Extraction is lenient about wrappers (a bare object, a JSON array, or
  bare `{..}\n{..}` sequences all parse) and **collapses identical (name+args)
  calls**, so a chatty model that prints its call inline *and* echoes it in a
  trailing ```` ```json ```` block isn't wrongly failed by the cardinality guard;
  genuinely distinct parallel calls are kept.
- **Plain-JSON tool-call contract.** The system prompt asks for a bare JSON
  object `{"name":…,"args":…}` (or a JSON array for several calls). The parser is
  lenient about wrappers and ```` ```json ```` fences, but it does **not** decode
  provider-specific tool envelopes — a model that emits harmony / channel tokens
  (`<channel|>…<tool_call|>…`) or unquoted-key pseudo-JSON is scored
  `malformed_json`, even when the *intended* call was correct. That's deliberate:
  a real prompt-based agent expecting JSON would also break, so the format failure
  is a true capability signal, not a harness artifact. (A tolerant pre-parser that
  repairs non-standard envelopes and reports format-compliance separately is a
  possible future feature — intentionally not done, so scores aren't inflated.)
- **Act-vs-abstain closing instruction (G1), reply-tool-AWARE.** The closing line of
  the system prompt is gated on the task's end_state, NOT fixed. An ABSTAIN task
  (`ExpectAbstainingText`) keeps *"If no tool is needed, just answer in plain text."*
  An ACT task (`RequireAll` / `RequireSequence`) mandates a tool — but the mandate is
  tailored to the toolset: if a **reporter tool is present** (the first tool with a
  `text` param — `reply` / `reply_customer`) it is named explicitly (*"call the
  `reply_customer` tool"*); on an **action-only** task (no reporter) the mandate is
  *"your tool actions are your final answer … do not call a tool that is not listed."*
  The naming fixes a `reply`-vs-`reply_customer` misnomer, and the action-only branch
  prevents a phantom `reply` call on the ~55 tasks whose deliverable IS their actions.
  This resolves the prior contradiction (a terminal-`reply` task used to invite plain
  text, failing a correct prose answer). A prose answer to an act-task is now scored
  `reported_in_prose` (content-correct, wrong-channel), distinct from a true
  hallucination — see the failure taxonomy.
- **Single-turn, greedy (temp 0), ~13-task fixture.** No multi-turn / agent
  loops; greedy decoding makes scores reproducible and comparable across quants
  (and sidesteps MLX's missing seed). The fixture is small and curated —
  **indicative, not leaderboard-grade.**
- **The four metrics are independent.** `parse_rate` (did it emit a parseable
  call when one was needed) is separate from tool/args accuracy, so "100% tool ·
  100% args but 50% parse" reads correctly as *"reasoning is fine, formatting is
  brittle"* — the #1 local-agent failure. A metric shows **n/a** (not 0) when no
  task exercises it. An unreachable backend → **"Not available"**, never a score.
- **Custom tasks** — author your own collections in the **Eval** tab (see the
  contract below). The runner treats built-in and custom tasks identically.

## Agentic reliability eval {#agentic-eval}

Where the tool-calling eval is single-turn, the **agentic** engine runs a model
through a stateful, multi-step loop inside a deterministic sandbox — measuring
not just whether the model claims success, but whether it *did the work*, and how
much compute it burned getting there. Agentic tasks live **alongside** single-turn
tasks in the same collection (an agentic `ToolTask` carries an optional `agentic`
spec); the **Eval** workspace runs a mixed collection across several models in one
streaming batch and renders a per-model Matrix (Pass^k · Avg Steps · Effort · Top
Error), with a click-through Trace Debugger. See [the workspace](#eval-runner).

- **Prompt-based sandbox, same as the tool-call eval.** The `DeterministicSandbox`
  holds the initial prompt, the tool schemas (injected into the system prompt via
  the shared `build_system_for`), the mock tool results, and an `EndStateRule`.
  No native function-calling — identical across Ollama / llama.cpp / MLX.
- **The loop.** Each turn: render the running transcript → model emits a JSON tool
  call (parsed with the same lenient `extract_calls`) → the sandbox returns the
  mocked result, injected back as a `"Tool result: …"` text message. A call the
  sandbox doesn't recognize gets an error injection and the loop continues. Mock
  lookup is on a **canonical key** (tool name + recursively key-sorted args), so a
  model that reorders its arg keys still hits the right mock.
- **The anti-cheat (`EndStateRule`).** Two variants. `RequireSequence` is an
  ordered checklist of `(tool, args)` checkpoints — the run succeeds **only** after
  the model calls each in order (same structural arg-equality the tool-call scorer
  uses). A model that yields with `{"status":"task_complete"}` without finishing the
  sequence is logged as a **hallucinated completion**, never a pass — it can't be
  gamed by claiming done. `ExpectAbstainingText` is the inverse: success is a correct
  plain-text refusal with **no** tool call (so a robust planner that declines an
  unsafe/unnecessary action isn't mis-scored as lazy); acting anyway fails.
- **Pass^k consistency.** The loop runs `k` times (default 5) with absolute
  isolation between runs. A per-run **backend** error (e.g. Ollama timed out or
  crashed on one attempt) does **not** abort the batch: that attempt is skipped and
  the remaining runs still execute, then the report folds the runs that completed —
  an infra fault is not a model task-failure, so a skipped run never reaches
  `total_runs`. Only when **every** run errors does the error propagate (the task
  then shows as Error and re-runs on resume — the backend is genuinely down). The
  per-task `AgenticReport` carries `passes/total_runs`, a
  `FailureTracker` with **distinct** tallies (`infinite_loop_hits` = hit the step
  cap, `hallucinated_completions` = fake done, `malformed_json_calls` = broken
  JSON, `schema_unrecovered_calls` = exhausted the recovery budget), and a
  `top_error` headline. `unknown_tool_calls` is a Phase-9 **diagnostic** tally
  (decoy / hallucinated-tool calls) — it captures *how* a model coped with decoys
  but is **not** a terminal failure, so it is excluded from `top_error`. The **collection-level Pass^k** (the Matrix headline and
  the readiness/leaderboard gate) is **strict**: `AggAgentic` credits a task only
  when **all k** of its runs reached the end state (`tasks_passed/tasks_total`), so a
  flaky 3/5 task counts as a failure, not 0.6 — reliability compounds and a model
  that "usually works" is not agent-ready. The run-level sums (`passes/total_runs`)
  are retained only as the secondary per-run rate behind the "Partial *p/k*" badge.
- **Lazy-agent traps (Driver B fault injection).** A task may attach `faults` —
  per-call `TransientError { status_code, clears_after }` or
  `PersistentError { status_code }`, keyed by the same canonical call form as the
  mocks. The sandbox checks a fault **before** advancing the checkpoint (so a
  trapped final call can never be a fake pass) and injects an `HTTP …` error as the
  tool result (a `ToolError` step). A transient clears after `clears_after`
  attempts — a robust agent retries through it to success; a persistent one never
  clears — a robust agent reports the failure (a graceful `Hallucinated` halt)
  rather than looping to the step cap. Attempt counters are **per-run** and
  **per-call**, so multi-tool tasks trap independently and run *k* is never poisoned
  by run *k-1*.
- **Schema resilience (Driver D semantic recovery).** When the task declares tool
  schemas, every parsed call is **semantically validated** (`validate_call`: known
  tool, all `required` params present, primitive types match) — distinct from "did
  it parse" and from "is it the right call". An invalid call injects a precise
  `[Schema error: key \`x\` required]` correction (a `SchemaError` step) and spends
  one of `max_recovery` (default 2) tries; producing a valid call after an error is
  a **recovery**, exhausting the budget ends the run as `MalformedSchema`. The
  report's `schema_resilience` is recovered ÷ runs-that-hit-an-error — **n/a** (UI
  "—") when no run ever hit one, never a fabricated 0. Constrained-decoding paths
  can't emit syntactically-broken calls, so this targets **semantic** faults.
- **Difficulty tiers (Phase 9) + the v2 scenario engine.** Eval content is now the
  **19 bundled tiered scenario collections** (Easy→Extreme across coding, finance,
  medical, legal, ecommerce, support, supply-chain, math/science, clinical) under
  `agentic/v2/scenarios/`. They **replaced** the old hand-coded single/multi fixtures.
  Each collection is one JSON object (`{name, domain, tier, pass_k, axes, tasks[]}`);
  `v2/collection.rs::load_v2_collection` transpiles it to engine `ToolTask`s
  (`category:"agent_loop"`, routed through the unchanged agentic runner — no second
  execution path). v2 task mechanics:
  - **`world_state`** — ground truth the model discovers via tools; the sandbox's
    `WorldState` responder returns the whole entity sub-object for the first arg that
    names a `world_state` key (`v2/world_state.rs`), so there are no static mocks.
  - **`expected_calls` → `EndStateRule::RequireAll`** — an unordered, consume-once
    set (multi-entity tasks have independent sub-sequences, so strict order would
    false-negative a correct model). Args match via `args_match_v2`: a `*…*` string is
    an ordered, case-insensitive multi-segment glob; everything else is exact.
  - **`must_not_call`** traps — invoking one (bare name, or `{name,args}` matched
    wildcard-aware) is an immediate terminal `ForbiddenCall`, checked after
    schema-validate (a malformed trap takes the recovery path first). pass^k
    punishes a model that springs a trap even once.
  - **`decoy_tools`** authored per task (presented but never expected); **`faults`**
    keyed by tool name (`on_call`, trips on any args, transient `clears_after` is a
    global per-tool counter).
  - **`tier`/`pass_k`** scale reliability — Easy 5 / Medium 8 / Hard 16 / Extreme 24
    (τ-bench: top models cluster at pass^1, spread at pass^8). `axes` document the
    tier (`min_required_steps`, decoys, hidden prereqs, conflicting constraints,
    adversarial/region variance). A permanent integrity test + an **oracle gate**
    (replays each task's expected_calls) prove all 434 authored tasks are satisfiable
    and a trivial agent scores 0.
  - **Procedural instancing** (`v2/generator.rs`) — a `generated` collection builds a
    FRESH instance each Pass^k run: `instantiate(task, seed_for(model, run_index))`
    consistently renames the task's numbered entity ids (its `world_state` keys) by a
    seeded offset across the prompt, world_state, checkpoints, and `must_not_call`. It's
    a bijective alpha-rename — decision logic untouched (oracle-safe), surface ids novel
    per run (contamination resistance), reproducible for a given `(model, run_index)`. A
    task with no numbered entities replays its worked instance unchanged (honest: runs,
    not varied). Deep per-template semantic generation (e.g. re-deriving which entity is
    sanctioned) is deferred.
  - **Runtime safety (v2 is heavy: ~80 steps × pass^24).** Each model turn has a 180s
    wall-clock budget (`run_once`) — the streaming client has no body deadline, so a
    stalled model would otherwise hang; a turn over budget ends the run as a terminal
    `TurnTimeout`. Cancellation is checked between Pass^k runs (`run_agentic_with`), so
    interrupting a big-k task halts within ≤1 run, not after all k. The Matrix panel
    shows a worst-case **cost estimate** ("~N model calls (~H h)") before a run.
- **Hardware-calibrated tier gate (Phase 9B).** `AggAgentic.by_tier` carries strict
  Pass^k bucketed per tier; the readiness `assess()` derives the highest tier a model
  cleared (`pass^k ≥ profile.min_pass_k`) and blocks when the profile's
  `required_tier` was **exercised by the collection** but not cleared. An untested
  tier is **NotAttempted**, never a guessed fail — so an all-Easy collection never
  trips a Hard profile. `readiness/hardware/hwclass.rs` maps total memory to a
  `HardwareClass` (rounded to the nearest GB to avoid boundary flip-flop) and a
  default required tier; built-in profiles ship `required_tier` Hard (coding) /
  Medium (rag, general), while a pre-Phase-9 saved profile defaults `Easy` and never
  blocks (exact old behavior). The verdict carries `required_tier` + `cleared_tier`,
  and the Agent Report renders graduated readiness per row ("✓ cleared Extreme /
  requires Extreme" or "▸ cleared Medium / requires Extreme") — shown only for a
  tiered profile, hidden for an untiered (Easy) one. A standalone hardware-class
  label in the header is deferred (the hardware-calibrated `required_tier` already
  conveys the bar).
- **Relative effort, not absolute joules.** `avg_output_tokens_success` is the mean
  output-token count (`eval_count`) over the **successful** runs only — **n/a**
  when there are zero successes, never a divide-by-zero. Prompt tokens are
  deliberately never summed (re-sent history would inflate it and ignore KV-cache
  reuse). A Q4 model that wanders 1,500 tokens to a result a Q8 finishes in 300 is
  the signal this exposes — the "faster" quant burning more compute for the same
  outcome.
- **The Matrix columns.** Per model: **Pass^k · Avg Steps · Effort · Schema Resil.
  · Cliff Depth · Top Error**. `Schema Resil.` is the Driver-D metric above;
  `Cliff Depth` is the measured context-cliff depth from the Audit probe (real
  `prompt_eval_count` at the accuracy collapse), read from the backend per
  (collection, model); unmeasured cells show **"Run probe ↗"** which pre-fills the
  Audit probe for that model (model + collection + context length + steps — see
  [#context-cliff](#context-cliff)), a live run shows **"probing…"**, a probe that
  found no collapse from a healthy baseline shows **"✓ no cliff"** (probed, accuracy
  held — not the same as unmeasured), and a probe whose baseline was already failing
  shows **"fails from start"** (red — broken at the smallest context, not a
  context-length limit; see the verdict table in [#context-cliff](#context-cliff)).
  An always-visible legend under the table explains the column + payoff.
  `Top Error` shows the dominant failure mode; when a model had
  any agentic failure an **ⓘ** sits next to the badge — hovering it reveals the full
  count of all four modes (Loop Cap · Fake Done · Bad Schema · Malformed), including
  the two the headline badge hides. The breakdown (and each column header) uses a
  **clip-safe tooltip** (`shared/ui/Tooltip`) that portals to `<body>` and is
  `position: fixed`, so the overflow-scrolled Matrix card can't clip it — replacing
  the native `title=` attribute, which the macOS WebView rendered unreliably.
  Faults and the recovery budget are authored in the Task & Sandbox Configurator
  (the **Fault Injection** box and **Max Recovery** field); single-turn tasks and
  fault-free agentic tasks omit both and round-trip byte-identical.

## Custom-eval collections {#custom-evals}

Run the curated built-in suite or your own task collections. Each collection is a
JSON **array of `ToolTask`** objects, saved as one `.json` file under
`app_config_dir/evals/` (portable — commit or send the file to share).

**Authoring (master-detail).** In the **Eval** tab, **+ New Collection** opens a
small name dialog, then an empty task list. **+ Add Task** opens a task in its
**detail** editor (id, prompt, tools JSON, expected JSON); **← Back** returns to
the list. Click any task row to reopen its detail. Validation is friendly and
inline — an empty prompt or id shows "Prompt: required" / "Task ID: required",
never a raw error. **Save** persists the collection (it then appears, selected, in
the sidebar). You can also **Import** an existing `.json` file (read by path, capped
at 1 MiB, validated). CRUD = create / edit / delete (✕ on a custom collection).

**Import CSV (bulk single-turn).** Next to Import .json, **Import CSV** opens a
modal that turns a flat spreadsheet into a custom collection — the on-ramp for
teams who keep test cases in a spreadsheet, not in `ToolTask` JSON. The strict
format is exactly four columns in order: `id,prompt,expected_tool,expected_args`
(one row per task; `expected_args` is a JSON object; an empty `expected_tool`
column means an **abstain** task). Tool schemas are supplied **once** in the modal's
**Tools schema** box and apply to every row, so the CSV stays flat. Scope is
**single-turn only** — `parallel`/`select`/`agentic` don't flatten cleanly and stay
on the JSON/configurator path. The file is read in Rust (`read_text_capped`, same
1 MiB cap; the frontend never reads files); the modal then parses + validates live:
a header in the wrong order is flagged with the exact column, every row gets a
green ✓ or a located red error (bad-JSON args, a tool not in the schema box, a
duplicate id, a missing field), and **Import stays disabled until the whole CSV is
clean** — a partly-broken CSV is never imported. Assembly reuses the same
`validateDrafts` gate as the form editor, and the save re-validates server-side.
(Format reference: Help → "CSV import".)

Any selection is editable — including a built-in preset; editing a preset and
saving writes a new custom copy (the bundled preset is read-only and stays a seed).

**Running.** Pick a model, then: **▶ Run this task** in a task's detail runs that
one task live (your current, even unsaved, edit) and shows its verdict checklist +
the four sub-scores; **▶ Run all** on the list runs the whole **saved** collection
(Save first — it's disabled while there are unsaved edits) and tags each row
pass/fail plus the aggregate Parse / Tool / Arg / Abstain bar.

A `ToolTask`:

```json
{
  "id": "weather-paris",
  "category": "single | parallel | select | abstain",
  "prompt": "What's the weather in Paris?",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "get_weather",
      "description": "Get the current weather for a city",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "city": { "type": "string", "description": "City name" } },
        "required": ["city"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "expected": { "type": "call", "name": "get_weather", "args": { "city": "Paris" } }
}
```

`tools[].parameters` is a **JSON-Schema object** — the shape you already paste
from real tool definitions. `expected` has three shapes (internally tagged):

- **`{ "type": "call", "name": …, "args": {…} }`** — exactly one tool call.
- **`{ "type": "parallel", "calls": [ {…}, … ] }`** — several at once (scored as
  an order-independent set).
- **`{ "type": "no_call" }`** — abstention: the model should *not* call a tool
  (e.g. a general-knowledge question with only an unrelated tool offered).

Every collection is validated **server-side** regardless of source — a
hand-edited or imported file with an unknown category, a malformed `parameters`
block, a category that disagrees with `expected`, or a call to a tool the task
doesn't offer is rejected as `invalid_task_schema`, naming the offending field.
The in-app "Check JSON" button mirrors this for fast feedback but is not the
trust boundary.

## Model inspector & template guard {#model-inspector}

The **Eval** tab inspects the selected installed model via Ollama's `/api/show`:

- **Chat template** — the model's Go chat template, shown verbatim as inert text
  (never executed/injected). Use it to debug *why* prompts misbehave: a template
  with no system/assistant roles can't honour a system prompt.
- **Capabilities** — the features Ollama reports (`completion`, `tools`, `insert`,
  `vision`, …). `tools` is the strongest "instruct/agent-ready" signal.
- **Base-model advisory** — a soft flag (with its reasoning) when the metadata
  looks like a base/text-completion model: no chat-role markers in the template
  **and** no `tools` capability. It's a heuristic, not a verdict — the panel says
  *why* ("no 'tools' capability; no chat-role markers"), so you can judge. A base
  model will ignore system prompts and tool-call unreliably.

**Ollama-only.** The template/capabilities come from `/api/show`; on llama.cpp /
MLX the panel shows "Not available — Ollama only" rather than guessing.

## VRAM & context fit {#vram-fit}

The Quant tab predicts whether a model **plus its context window** fits in memory — the failure
that silently OOMs or spills to CPU. Pick a context length (4K/8K/32K/128K, capped at the model's
max) and each quant's fit becomes:

```
required = base_weights + KV_cache
KV_cache = 2 (K+V) × layers × kv_heads × head_dim × 2 (f16 bytes) × context_length
```

(`head_dim = embedding_length / head_count`.) The KV cache grows **linearly with context** and is
independent of the weight quantization — so a model that fits at 4K can OOM at 128K. When `required`
exceeds available memory the quant shows an **"OOM Risk"** badge and can't be run at that context;
the recommendation honours the same gate.

- **Dims come from Ollama `/api/show`.** On llama.cpp / MLX the predictor falls back to a
  file-size × 1.3 heuristic, **flagged approximate** (`~`).
- **Speed is memory-bandwidth-bound, not FLOPS-bound.** Token throughput tracks GB/s, so the tab
  shows the chip's nominal bandwidth (curated table) or "Not available" — never a guessed number.

## Silent CPU fallback {#cpu-fallback}

When a model doesn't fully fit the accelerator, Ollama quietly offloads layers to system RAM and
keeps running — far slower, and it silently ruins any speed/eval timing. The Eval tab flags this for
the selected model from `/api/ps` (`size_vram` vs `size`): "⚠ ~X% of this model is on CPU". Shown
only when an accelerator is present and weights are actually spilled — **Ollama-only**, nothing
fabricated on other backends or when the model isn't loaded.

## Context budget {#context-budget}

The Inspector shows how much of the context window a run consumed — the exact server-reported
`prompt_eval_count` over the model's `context_length` — turning red at ≥95% (past which earlier
tokens are silently dropped). Exact counts only; "Not available" when either number is missing.

## STT Inspector {#stt-inspector}

After a transcription finishes, the STT workspace shows a measured profile of the run. Like the
text Inspector, it never fabricates a number — any metric the backend can't supply reads **"N/A"**:

- **Real-time factor (RTF)** — decoded audio seconds ÷ wall-clock seconds; `> 1×` is faster than
  real time. The denominator is the **decoded sample count** (a hardware fact), so it's the same
  across WAV / MP3 / OGG of the same audio, not biased by container metadata.
- **First-segment latency** — time to the first streamed segment (the speech analog of TTFT).
- **Encode / decode split** — **N/A**: whisper-server reports no per-phase timing (the total is the
  RTF wall above). Never split by a guess.
- **Repeated-token rate** — adjacent duplicate segments (a stuck/looping decode). `0%` is a real
  measurement (counted, none found).
- **Mean confidence** — average of whisper's word-level probabilities, with the low (5th-percentile)
  tail. **N/A** when the backend emits no probabilities — never shown as 0% or 100%.
- **Output during silence** — fraction of segments the model emitted where an **independent** voice
  detector (`webrtc-vad`, never the model's own judgement) found no speech and the model was itself
  unsure. The highest-value behavioral signal for hallucination.
- **VRAM** — **"Not available for this backend"**: whisper.cpp doesn't report runtime VRAM.

The behavioral analysis runs off the transcription's timed path, so measuring it never inflates the
RTF it reports.

### In the Analysis & Inspector tabs {#stt-inspector-tabs}

The same measured profile is surfaced with the visual density of the LLM views. Once a
transcription completes, an **STT section auto-appears** in both the **Analysis** and **Inspector**
tabs (alongside any LLM run — neither clobbers the other). It survives tab navigation because the
finished transcript is held in a durable store, not the transient live-transcript store.

- **Analysis** — RTF, words/sec, and first-segment latency as ruler bars (the speech analog of the
  throughput / TTFT bars), the full transcript text, and **Export Markdown / JSON** of the metrics +
  raw segments. **words/sec** is a *measured* count (real whitespace words ÷ wall seconds), **N/A**
  when wall time is missing — never an estimate.
- **Inspector** — a wall-time **phase bar** `[ first segment | transcription ]` (the only honest
  split — whisper-server reports no model-load / encode / decode breakdown), the **confidence
  timeline**, a **confidence distribution** histogram, and the **metric-card grid**.

**Confidence timeline (the per-token-latency analog).** whisper-server reports no per-segment
*processing* time, so the latency chart can't be mirrored literally. Instead the hero chart plots
**per-segment confidence over the audio timeline** — x = audio time, y = `exp(avg_logprob)` ∈ 0..1,
each bar spanning its segment's audio extent. A segment with no logprob is a **gap**, never a
guessed 0. Two scrutiny flags colour a bar, using **whisper's own quality gates** (stable and
interpretable, not a per-run relative threshold that would mislabel the worst segment of a clean
transcript):

- **low confidence** — `avg_logprob < -1.0` (whisper's decode-failure cut).
- **speech over silence** — `no_speech_prob > 0.6` (whisper's default `no_speech_threshold`) yet text
  was emitted — the per-segment hallucination signal that complements the run-level *Output during
  silence* rate above.

**The voice pipeline (STT → LLM).** When an LLM runs on the transcript — the **Auto-summarize**
toggle (the STT→LLM auto-pipe), the voice panel's **Ask**, or a plain **Workspace** run after a
transcription — its metrics render through the **same rich LLM views** as any other run: the full
per-token `ModelTimeline` (phase bar, VRAM, context budget, token-latency chart) in the Inspector and
the throughput / TTFT bars in the Analysis tab. The STT section sits **directly below** it, so both
stages of the pipeline read top-to-bottom on one page. There is no separate, thinner LLM card — the
LLM run is mirrored into the normal compare rows, so it stays the single source of those numbers.
For the auto-pipe (where the two stages are linked by transcript id), an **end-to-end one-liner**
`Audio → Transcript → LLM · end-to-end` is appended with an `auto` badge; the time is the *processing*
total (STT wall + LLM wall, not the audio length), and it appears only when the LLM ran for the
transcript currently shown, so the two stages are never mismatched.

## STT Eval & Readiness {#stt-eval}

Beyond the per-transcript Inspector, the **Analysis** tab has an **STT Eval & Readiness** panel that
scores transcription *accuracy* across a batch and gives a go/no-go verdict. It is **decoupled from
transcription**: it scores transcripts you've **already** produced (read from disk), so a sidecar
crash can't kill a sweep, and you can re-score with a new metric in milliseconds without re-running
the model.

**The eval spec** is a small text file — one task per transcript, joined **by id**:
`{ id, reference, critical_tokens }`. `reference` is the ground-truth text; `critical_tokens` are the
words that *must* be right.

- **Reference present** → **WER** via word alignment (insertions/deletions don't smear into
  substitutions), plus **weighted WER** and **critical-token accuracy**.
- **Reference absent** → **behavioral-only**: WER reads **"N/A — accuracy unverified"**, never a
  fabricated number, and it can neither pass nor fail the accuracy gate.

**Weighted WER (financial/legal).** A critical token counts **5×** in the weighted figure — so a
mis-transcribed dollar amount or payee dominates the score while a missed "the" barely registers. The
readiness gate keys on this weighted figure (it equals the plain WER when a task has no critical
tokens). A **confident** substitution (the model was sure, e.g. the reader said "reuben" for "ruben")
is flagged as a likely **human misread** and shown separately, so a reader's slip on a read-aloud
clip isn't blamed on the model.

**Readiness verdict.** Pick a profile (built-ins: **Production dictation**, **High accuracy
(legal/financial)**, **Fast draft**) and Assess. Each model gets **Ready / Conditional / Not ready**
(ranked best-first), gating on: **speed** (`min_rtf` — too slow is an explicit hard fail, not a vague
one), **weighted WER** (`max_wer`), and behavioral targets (repeats / output-during-silence /
confidence, as soft conditions). The verdict spells out every blocking reason and condition verbatim.

## Built-in presets & the finance set {#builtin-presets}

The tool-call eval ships built-in presets — **Curated Suite** and **Finance (preset)** — selectable
alongside your own collections. The bundled files are read-only, but selecting a preset loads its
tasks into the editor, so you can tweak them and Save an editable copy under your own name. The
finance set exercises balance / sum /
transaction-search tools (+ abstention). It measures **structural tool-call reliability** (does the
model emit the right call?), **not** data/PDF parsing — the "expected" is the *command*, never the
underlying data.

## Collection matrix & regression history {#matrix}

The **LLM Performance Matrix** (in the Eval tab) batch-runs a whole collection across several
installed models at once and tracks how scores move over time. Pick an **Active Collection**, choose
models from the **Models** dropdown, and press ▶ Run. Models run **sequentially** (local backends dislike
concurrent load); one model's backend being down is captured as that **column's error** and never
aborts the rest of the batch.

- **Matrix view** — rows = tasks, columns = models. Each cell shows **P T A** (parse / tool-match /
  arg-match, green pass / red fail) or **Abs ✓/✗** for abstention tasks, so failure patterns jump out.
  The footer shows **Avg. Score** (mean composite across the models that ran).
- **Timeline view** — a composite-score trend line per model across consecutive runs, so an engine
  update or prompt change that regresses tool-calling shows as a visible drop. The axes are labelled
  (**y** = composite score %, **x** = run order, oldest → newest); hover a point for its exact value.
  **Runs** = recorded history entries for the collection.

Each successful model run is appended to an append-only JSON log at
`app_config_dir/history/<collection>.json`, **capped at 100 entries** (oldest dropped). Like
collections, these are plain, human-readable files — no database.

## Tool-call pipeline visualizer {#pipeline}

The **LLM Tool-Calling Evaluator** makes a single task's run transparent — no black box. Pick a
collection + task + model and press ▶; step through four phases with the ◀ ▶ stepper:

1. **Input Config** — the user prompt + the tool definitions (JSON schema) the task carries.
2. **System Pkg** — the **Constructed System Message** *actually sent* to the model (tools injected).
3. **Stream** — the **real** `> INFERENCE STREAM`: the model's actual raw completion (not a mock built
   from the expected answer).
4. **Verify** — the Evaluation Engine Report mapping the structural verdict to named checks
   (**JSON Regex Extraction** = parsed, **Tool Name Key Match** = tool match, **Parameter Type
   Validation** = args match; abstain tasks show **Correct Abstention**) with an *N% SUCCESS* badge.

The **Execution State** and **Validation** (Pending / PASSED / FAILED) rows track the run. This is
powered by a dedicated `trace_toolcall_task` command that runs one task and returns the exact system
message, raw output, and verdict — the same single-task path `run_eval` uses, so the trace matches a
real run. A stopped backend surfaces as a clear error rather than a hang.

**Cached traces (no re-run).** Running the Simulator or the Matrix saves each task's full trace to
`app_config_dir/traces/<collection>.json`. Clicking a Simulator row's **View Trace** or a **Matrix
cell** opens the Debugger on the saved data instantly — **Execution State: Cached**, no inference —
so you can inspect what the model received and returned without re-running. Press ▶ to re-run live.
The cache is best-effort: if it's missing (e.g. an older run) or a write failed, the Debugger falls
back to a live trace.

## Eval Runner: Scoreboard ↔ Debugger {#eval-runner}

The Simulator and the Pipeline visualizer are paired under an **Eval Runner** toggle in the Eval tab:

- **Batch Scoreboard** — the *Tool-Calling Evaluation Simulator*. It has its own **Active Collection**
  picker, so it batch-runs **any** collection — your own custom collections as well as the built-in
  presets — against one model, showing the per-task pass/fail table, the category bar chart, and the
  aggregate sub-scores + composite.
- **Trace Debugger** — the single-task Pipeline visualizer above.

Each Scoreboard row has a **View Trace** button: clicking it flips the toggle to the Debugger and loads
that exact collection + task + model, ready to ▶ — connecting the macro "which tasks failed?" view to
the micro "why did this one fail?" trace.

**Run Controls — difficulty tier + anti-saturation (Phase 9).** The Eval Manager's run controls expose
the Phase-9 levers inline, so the chosen tier and decoy budget genuinely shape the batch (they flow into
`run_batch_eval` → `apply_overrides`, which rewrites each agentic spec at run time):

- **Difficulty Tier** dropdown — `Auto · Easy · Medium · Hard · Extreme`. The chosen tier **filters the
  Built-In collection list to that tier only** (selecting a tier auto-picks the first in-tier collection;
  `Auto` = the machine's recommended tier). The tier also flows to the backend as `tier`.
- **Iterations (k)** — **always editable**, pre-filled with the chosen tier's *recommended* Pass^k
  (Easy 5 / Medium 8 / Hard 16 / Extreme 24; TS mirror `PASS_K_BY_TIER`, source of truth `passk.rs`)
  shown as a "recommended: N" hint. The (possibly hand-edited) `k` is always sent and **wins** over the
  tier policy in `apply_overrides`. The pre-fill is a programmatic write guarded by a synchronous ref so
  the async `Auto`-resolves-from-hardware path can never clobber a value the user typed (or a concrete
  tier they just picked).
- **HW hint** — "HW: 16GB RAM · Mainstream · Medium recommended" comes from the new `get_hardware_tier`
  command (the single source of truth; the GB thresholds + class→tier policy live in `hwclass.rs`, never
  duplicated in TS).
- **Anti-Saturation** — an `Enable Decoy Tools` checkbox + `Decoy Count`. Enabled sends `decoyTools = N`,
  which rewrites each agentic spec's `axes.decoy_tools` (N never-correct distractor tools shuffled into
  the presented tool list); disabled (the default) leaves the task-authored decoys untouched.
- **Scoreboard header chips** echo the active run's shape: `Target: <model> · Tier: <…> · K: <k> ·
  Decoys: <n/off>`.
- **Per-task authoring** — there is no collection-level "Edit" button; instead, **clicking a collection**
  in the left sidebar expands/collapses its task list beneath it (accordion; clicking also selects it),
  and each task row reveals **Edit** + **Delete** on hover. Edit opens that task in the configurator; Delete removes it (a built-in is read-only, so a
  delete/edit **forks the collection to a saved custom copy** — the bundled original is untouched). New
  blank collections are created via **+ New Collection** at the end of the collection list.
- **Sidebar order** (top→bottom): Model → Difficulty Tier → Collections (data-source toggle + tier-filtered
  list + New/Import JSON/CSV) → Iterations → Max Steps → Anti-Saturation (with an ⓘ explaining decoys) →
  Native-FC + RUN BATCH + Export.

Deferred (flagged, not faked): **Max Steps stays a normal editable input** — the backend has no
tier→max-steps policy to lock it to. A **"Conditional" per-task status** isn't shown (task outcomes are
Pass/Fail only; Conditional exists for readiness verdicts, not per task). The trace panel's AST tab +
inline decoy/hallucination annotations are out of scope (the Evaluator/Trace panel is untouched).

## Context-cliff probe {#context-cliff}

Runs a dataset at increasing prompt lengths and graphs where tool-call accuracy collapses
— the "context cliff" many local models hit well before their advertised window. The engine is the
**Tauri-free** `inference/eval/cliff/` module (`run_context_cliff` command), so the ladder, padding,
needle sweep, verify-and-adjust, and classification are all unit-tested without a window; the frontend
only charts the verified series it returns. The x-axis is the model's **real measured prompt-token
depth** (`prompt_eval_count` reported by the backend, averaged over the rung's tasks) — **not** a
chars/4 estimate. A rung the backend reports no token count for shows **"Not available"** rather than a
made-up x.

**Padding (license-clean, char-boundary-safe).** Filler comes from one of three embedded synthetic
presets — **Corporate Policy** (prose), **System Logs** (structured), **Financial Ledger** (tabular),
each `include_str!`-bundled — or the user's own text. The engine cycles the source in 4 KB chunks to a
byte target and slices only at UTF-8 char boundaries (`safe_boundary`), so a multi-byte preset/file can
never panic the probe. The instruction (the **needle**) is injected at swept fractional depths
**[0.1, 0.5, 0.9]** (front / middle / back) — never tail-only, because the tail tests recency (the
model's strongest position); mid-document is where models actually fail. A rung's "Accuracy" is the
**worst composite across those positions** — "passes across positions" means robust everywhere.

**Verify-and-adjust (the depth is measured, never requested).** Each rung seeds padding from the
**learned bytes-per-token rate** for this (model, source) — measured on the first padded rung, so every
later rung lands within tolerance on a single sweep — then checks the real `prompt_eval_count` and, only
if it's more than **±5%** off, rebuilds proportionally once. The **reported depth is the verified token
count**, never the requested one. `cliff_tokens` is the largest verified context where the task still
passed across all positions.

**Cost control (early-stop).** The deepest rungs are the slowest (the model must process the whole
padded prompt), so the engine stops as soon as the outcome is decided: a **broken baseline** stops
before any padded rung runs, and the **first collapse** stops the ladder (deeper rungs would only
re-confirm failure at the highest cost). Three needle positions, one sweep per rung, and early-stop keep
a probe affordable; lowering **Test Steps** / **Max Tokens** trims it further.

**Live progress (monotonic, never a false 100%).** The bar/percentage read a single fraction
(`frac`) owned by `cliffStore` (`progressFraction`), not a value recomputed in the panel. Rung
boundaries are anchored on the authoritative per-rung counter (`done`/`total` from the `cliff-progress`
/ `on_rung` event); the fine-grained `cliff-step` stream only fills **within** the current incomplete
rung, **capped at `RUNG_FILL_CAP` (0.9)** of that rung's slice. The cap reserves headroom so a single
sweep can never claim the rung is finished before `on_rung` confirms it — which is what made the old bar
hit 100% and then jump back to ~80% when a **verify-and-adjust** re-sweep reset the position/task
counters. `frac` is also kept **monotonic** across the run (a re-sweep holds the bar, never walks it
back) and is **snapped to 1 on completion**, so an **early-stopped** probe — which stops below the last
rung — still reads 100% rather than freezing short. The ETA is a labelled `~` extrapolation from
`elapsed ÷ frac`, never presented as exact.

The probe owns its own **Active Collection** picker (independent of the EvalManager editor), so it
always has a real dataset to run. The **Max Tokens** control sets the deepest rung and is capped at the
model's reported **context window** when known (Ollama `/api/show` dims), falling back to a fixed
ceiling otherwise; the backend forces `num_ctx` above the deepest rung so the padding isn't truncated.
A **Padding** picker chooses the preset. Decoding is **always greedy (temp 0)** — a cliff is a
*diagnostic* and must reproduce for a given (collection, model), so the engine pins it; there is no
local toggle. A run that errors surfaces a **"Not available — …"** banner rather than a silent blank chart.

**Agentic tasks are scored on JSON well-formedness, not abstention.** The probe pads ONE prompt, injects
the needle, and scores the model's ONE reply — it never runs the multi-turn sandbox. An **agentic** task
carries only a placeholder `expected: no_call` (its real criterion is `agentic.end_state`, scored by the
batch agentic loop), so scoring it against `expected` would read that literally and fail every correct
tool call as a forced abstention — a fabricated **Broken 0%**. Instead the cliff **ignores** the
placeholder and scores an agentic task purely on whether the model emitted a **well-formed, parseable
tool call** at that depth (`verdict.parsed`); tool/arg correctness is the end-state's job, not the
probe's (`engine::cliff_score` / `cliff_failed`). So an all-agentic collection yields a genuine
**formatting cliff** — the context length where the model's tool-call JSON stops parsing — and a rung's
composite **blends** single-turn correctness with agentic well-formedness by task count (both in [0,1]).
Broken JSON at a depth is captured in the rung's trace (marked `passed: false`) like any other failing step. Full end-state
agentic scoring under padding (the sandbox loop, needle across turns, Pass^k per rung) remains a separate
future probe — see `process.md#future-considerations`.

**How each rung's "Accuracy" is scored.** Each rung re-runs the dataset and reports the **composite
tool-call score** (0–100%) — the mean of the available sub-metrics defined in
[#toolcall-eval](#toolcall-eval): `parse_rate` (emitted a parseable call when one was
expected), `tool_selection_acc` (right tool name), `arg_acc` (right arguments), `abstain_acc`
(correctly stayed silent when no call was expected). Each sub-metric uses a **cascaded conditional
denominator** so a format failure doesn't bleed into the reasoning metrics, and a sub-metric with a
zero denominator is **n/a (excluded)**, not 0. A per-step status of **Pass / Failure** is just that
composite vs a **50%** bar.

**The four probe verdicts** (the backend engine classifies into the persisted `CliffStatus`;
`frontend/src/features/eval/cliff.ts::classifyCliff` mirrors the same rules over the returned series for
the read-out, so the persisted status and the displayed verdict can never disagree):

| Verdict | Condition | Matrix cell |
|---|---|---|
| **cliff** | Healthy baseline (rung 0 ≥ 50%), then a rung drops **≥ 20pp** below it | **N tok** (that rung's measured depth) |
| **no-cliff** | Healthy baseline (rung 0 ≥ 50%) that held across the whole range | **✓ no cliff** (green) |
| **broken-baseline** | Rung 0 itself scored **below 50%** — the model fails at the *smallest* context | **fails from start** (red) |
| **no-baseline** | Rung 0 errored (no composite) — nothing to compare against | **Run probe ↗** (unmeasured) |

The **broken-baseline** case is the important guardrail: a model stuck at 0% on every rung has no
healthy plateau to "fall off", so it is **never** dressed up as "✓ no cliff" — it's flagged red as a
tool-call failure (not a context-length limit). Single-turn, greedy — a failed rung is a gap, never a
fabricated score.

**Per-step trace (padded input + output, not just a 0%).** A bare "Broken" / 0% is undebuggable on its
own — you can't tell a prose answer from a refusal from a wrong-schema call. So each rung now carries a
**`TaskTrace { task_id, outputs: TraceOutput[] }`** list on `CliffPoint.trace`, grouped by task: every needle
position's `TraceOutput { depth, prompt, output, passed }` — captured for **every** task at that rung, pass
*or* fail (not failure-only), so the trace shows what the model actually saw and emitted at each step.
`prompt` is the **padded input** (the synthetic padding with the instruction injected at `depth`), head+tail-capped
(`MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`) so the enormous context is visible — the needle at the front or back survives the cap —
without hauling the full multi-KB prompt through IPC. The system prompt (the same boilerplate + tool-schema JSON
every turn) is deliberately NOT carried — it's noise in a per-step trace. System/output are char-capped (`MAX_SYSTEM_CHARS` /
`MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS`) and the task list is bounded (`MAX_TRACE_TASKS`) so it never hauls a full transcript
through IPC. The trace **streams per rung** with the live `cliff-progress` events (not bundled only in the
final report), so each completed row's trace is inspectable as the probe runs. The panel surfaces it as a
per-row **"View trace"** toggle (the table is `[Step][Tokens][Accuracy][Status][Trace]`, with an ⓘ on
*Accuracy* explaining the composite) that expands the system prompt + per-position outputs on demand —
nothing is dumped all at once. The *Accuracy* composite itself: single-turn = mean of parse / tool-select /
arg / abstain; agentic = JSON well-formedness; the two blended by task count; the row shows the worst of
the three needle positions.

**Persistence + the Agent Report (three-state cliff).** Every terminal probe outcome is now persisted
(not just a found collapse): the store holds a `CliffStatus` per (collection, model) —
`NoCliff { tested }` (held to that depth), `Collapsed { depth }`, or (broken-baseline) `Collapsed` at
the first rung; an unprobed model is `NotProbed`. So `assess_readiness` reflects the probe: a held probe
reads **"✓ No cliff (≥tested tok)"**, a collapse **"Collapsed at depth tok"**, unprobed **"N/A"** — no
longer a misleading "N/A" after a successful probe. The legacy bare-`u32` store migrates to `Collapsed`.
The `min_context_tokens` hard gate is **strict**: `Collapsed` passes iff `depth ≥ min`, and `NoCliff`
passes iff `tested ≥ min` (an incomplete probe is not a pass); `NotProbed` blocks. Off in the built-in
profiles, so cliff stays informational unless a custom profile opts in.

**The probe is part of the pipeline, not a dead-end.** The journey is Eval → Audit → Agent Report.
On the **Performance Matrix**, an unmeasured *Cliff Depth* cell shows **"Run probe ↗"** which
**pre-fills** the probe for that model + the current collection + a context length and switches to the
Audit tab — it **never auto-runs** (a misclick must not lock the GPU on a long sweep); you click
**Execute**. An *already-measured* cell instead shows a small **"↻"** re-probe control beside its depth
badge that takes the same pre-fill-and-open-Audit path (also never auto-running) — the workflow for
**re-validating** a model after a runtime/driver change rather than trusting a stale measurement.
The run lives in a store, so it **survives tab navigation** (a progress bar shows rung
X/N at ~N tokens; **Stop** cancels). On completion the cliff is saved to the backend **per
(collection, model)** — `~/.config/quantamind/cliff/<collection>.json`, written atomically
(temp-file + rename) with the **raw** model name as the key (colons intact). The Matrix then shows the
real **N tok** (read from the backend, not browser storage), and `assess_readiness` feeds each model's
cliff into the verdict: the Agent Report **displays** the Cliff depth, and the context gate **blocks**
(*"reasoning cliff at X < Y needed"*) only when a profile **opts in** via `min_context_tokens` (now
editable in the profile modal). The gate is off by default, so an un-probed model is never silently
failed for context.

## Comparing across models/quants needs Ollama {#multi-model-ollama-only}

Anything that runs *several models* in one go — the **Quant** tab's quality and
tool-call comparison columns, and "Compare speed in Bench" — only works on
**Ollama**. Ollama serves any installed model by name, so QuantaMind can switch
between quants on a single running server.

`llama.cpp` (`llama-server`) and **MLX** (`mlx_lm.server`) are **single-model
servers**: each loads one model at launch and serves whatever it has loaded,
ignoring the requested name. So on those backends:

- The Quant comparison buttons are **disabled** with a note — size/fit and the
  recommendation still work (they're computed from the file, not the server).
- The Eval / tool-call panels show a note: the run targets **whichever model the
  server has loaded**, so load the exact model you mean to test (or use Ollama to
  compare across models).

This is a property of those servers, not a QuantaMind limitation; auto-restarting
a single-model server per model is a deferred future option.

## Local Agent Readiness {#agent-readiness}

The **Agent Report** tab turns a collection's last batch run into a transparent
per-model verdict answering *"is this local model ready to replace my cloud
agent?"*. It adds no new measurement — it synthesizes the Phase-6 agentic metrics
([Agentic reliability eval](#agentic-eval)) against a **profile** and shows the
exact reasons. Pick a target collection + a profile, click **Run readiness**.

**The verdict.** Each model gets one of three statuses, never a black-box number:

- 🟢 **Ready** — meets every gate in the profile.
- 🟡 **Conditional** — passes the hard gates but trips a *soft target* (e.g. slow,
  or inefficient step count). The reason carries the interpolated math, e.g.
  `slow: 8400ms/step > 5000ms target`.
- 🔴 **NotReady** — trips a *hard gate*. Reasons are explicit and carry the exact
  measured counts, e.g. `pass^k 0.40 < 0.80 required`, `loops on 2 runs`,
  `false 'done' on 1 run`, or `run error: …` for a column that failed to produce
  data. The report's BLOCKING line tags each by category with a ✗ marker
  (`[✗ Reliability] [✗ Loops]`, plus `Context`, `Hardware`, `Native FC`,
  `Run Error`, `Performance`, `Efficiency`); every backend reason maps to a real
  category — none falls through to a bare `System`. The Details line below shows
  the interpolated numbers/message verbatim.

**Blocking vs conditions.** Hard gates push to `blocking[]` (→ NotReady); soft
targets push to `conditions[]` (→ Conditional). Status = NotReady if any blocking,
else Conditional if any conditions, else Ready.

**Never fabricated.** A metric the engine didn't measure is N/A, never a guessed
pass. If a profile *requires* a metric that wasn't measured (e.g. `require_full_vram`
with no VRAM-fit measurement, or `min_context_tokens` with no cliff probe), that is
**blocking** — ignorance is not a pass; the report tells you to run the missing
diagnostic. The `pass^k` core gate likewise blocks when no agentic run was recorded.
Float comparisons are epsilon-guarded (`1e-6`) so a true `0.80` can't false-block.

**The per-model deep-dive (Phase 9B).** Below the multi-model table a model selector
opens a three-section drill-down for one model, sourced from `ModelVerdict.by_tier` /
`failures` — the **same native-first aggregate the gate read** (one `native_first_source`
helper feeds the gate, the per-tier breakdown, and the taxonomy, so they can't drift):

- **Executive Verdict** — the headline tier is the **tier that actually ran** (the highest
  tier exercised in `by_tier`), *not* the profile's `required_tier`. The hardware class
  (`get_hardware_tier`) is an **advisory lens, never a gate**: a Workstation user who
  deliberately runs Easy gets *Ready (Easy)* plus a soft "run a harder tier for a
  production-grade verdict" note, never a forced NotReady. Status answers "did it clear the
  tier it was tested at" via a contiguous `clearsThrough` — READY when it clears up to the
  hardest tested tier, CONDITIONAL for a cleared prefix **or** a non-monotonic curve (a
  higher tier cleared above a failed lower one — flagged inconsistent), NOT READY when
  nothing cleared.
- **Tier Progression Matrix** — four tier cards with measured per-tier Pass^k + avg-steps
  and a CLEAR / SATURATED / FAIL badge on the **same `min_pass_k` bar** the verdict's
  `cleared_tier` uses, so a card and the headline can't contradict. A tier the run never
  exercised is **NOT TESTED** (gray), never a guessed fail. "Task Parameters"
  (Horizon/Decoys) come from the collection's **real task axes** or read "not declared" —
  the mockup's illustrative `3–8 steps` / `2–4 decoys` ranges are never printed as measured.
- **Failure Taxonomy** — the distribution of failure modes (`unknown_tool_calls`→decoys,
  `forbidden_calls`→`must_not_call`, loops, hallucinations, …) summed across the **tiers
  that actually ran** (named in the heading — not a hardcoded Hard+Extreme, so a Mainstream
  Easy/Medium run gets a truthful section), as a share of tracked failure **events** (not a
  1:1 failed-run count). The deep-dive exports as **versioned** JSON (`schema_version`).

Pool-injected **decoys reach only the prompt-based pass** (the native tool_calls API is
handed the raw `task.tools`); a `Decoys: N` figure therefore describes the prompt column,
not the native one — a pre-existing asymmetry, documented so it isn't misread.

**Profiles** are flat JSON files under the OS app-config dir (`readiness/`),
editable by power users and seeded on first run with three built-ins:

| Profile | Min Pass^k | Forbid loops | Forbid fake-done | Full VRAM | Soft targets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coding agent | 80% | yes | yes | **yes** | ≤8 steps · ≤5000 ms/step |
| RAG assistant | 70% | yes | yes | no | ≤5 steps · ≤8000 ms/step |
| General agent | 60% | yes | no | no | — |

Built-ins gate on the metrics the engine measures: since Phase 7.4 wired VRAM fit,
**Coding agent** turns `require_full_vram` on (a model that spills past the cap is
NotReady). The `min_context_tokens` and native-FC hard gates stay **off** in
built-ins — those measurements aren't wired yet, and with strict null-gating an
unmeasured requirement would mark every model NotReady for infra reasons. Author a
custom profile to switch any gate on and get exactly that strict behaviour.
Long/nested profile ids are safe: the file is keyed by a 40-char slug plus an
8-hex hash of the full id, so two ids sharing a prefix never collide.

**VRAM fit (Hardware Telemetry).** The Host Hardware Profile panel shows the detected
architecture (Apple unified memory / NVIDIA discrete / CPU) and an allocation-cap
dropdown defaulting to your VRAM (unified RAM on Apple), overridable in-session
(never persisted). For each **Ollama** model the verdict measures the footprint —
exact on-disk weights + the real f16 KV cache (the canonical `vram_math` formula) at
the run's `num_ctx` (falling back to a capped **8 k** dev window — `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CTX`,
bounded by the model max — never the model's full 262 k context, which would balloon the
cache past any real workload; the line shows the assumed context as `@ 8k ctx`) — against the cap: `fits` when total ≤ cap, a soft **high VRAM
pressure** condition at ≥85% of the cap, **won't fit** otherwise (which, under
`require_full_vram`, blocks). The per-model line reads `VRAM: 6.0 GB (5.0 model +
1.0 cache) < 24 GB cap · fits`. Single-model backends (llama.cpp / MLX) where precise
dims aren't available show **N/A (single-model backend)** — never an approximated fit;
under `require_full_vram` that N/A blocks (ignorance is not a pass). Lower the cap and
a fitting model flips to NotReady deterministically — model the exact hardware you're
buying for.

**Metadata resilience.** Some newer Ollama archs (e.g. `qwen35`) omit
`attention.head_count_kv` from `/api/show`. Rather than mark such a model "VRAM fit not
measured" (which would wrongly block it under `require_full_vram`), the dims parser
defaults a missing KV head count to `head_count` (MHA, the GGUF convention) and labels
the result a **conservative estimate** — for a GQA model this overestimates the KV
cache, so it can only ever under-promise fit, never over-promise it. The per-model line
and the recommendation banner say the figure is a conservative estimate; the other four
dims stay required (still N/A if any is missing). This keeps the "never fabricate —
label estimates" contract while not penalising a working model for incomplete metadata.

**Prompt-based vs native path.** Two ways a model can do tool-calling, measured and
labelled **separately** so they're never conflated. The **prompt-based** proxy injects
the tool schemas into the system prompt and parses the text JSON the model emits — the
only cross-backend-fair method. The **native** path (Phase 7.2) runs the *same* agentic
tasks through the model's real `tool_calls` API — the path a production agent actually
uses.

- **Measuring native.** Tick **Measure native tool-calling (Ollama)** on the Eval run.
  For each **Ollama** model that reports the `tools` capability (`/api/show`), QuantaMind
  runs a parallel pass via `/api/chat` with a native `tools` array, parses the real
  `tool_calls`, and shows a **Native FC pass^k** column in the Matrix (behind a toggle).
  Only the call *extraction* differs — the deterministic sandbox, scoring, and failure
  taxonomy are identical, so the two columns are comparable. An empty/abstaining
  `tool_calls` is scored as a correct no-call; parallel `tool_calls` are processed
  one-per-step (the sandbox is sequential). **Ollama-only** today: llama.cpp / MLX show
  **N/A**, never a guessed score — hovering an N/A native cell explains why ("non-Ollama
  backend, or the model has no tools capability"), so following the *enable native* nudge
  never dead-ends at a silent N/A. (The **RUN BATCH** button likewise explains any disabled
  state on hover — "Select at least one model" / "This collection has no tasks".)
- **In the verdict.** When native was measured for a model, the readiness verdict
  **prefers it** — the core Pass^k gate and the loop/hallucination gates use the native
  result, and the row is labelled **(Native FC)**. Models without a native measurement
  fall back to the prompt-based proxy, labelled **(Prompt-Based)**. So a model that passes
  the prompt proxy but fails the native path reads **NotReady** on the path your app
  actually uses — the honest gap, made visible.

**Source of truth.** `run_batch_eval` persists the full report per collection; the
`assess_readiness` command loads it and calls the one pure scoring function
(`readiness::assess`) — the same function a future headless CLI will link, so GUI
and CLI verdicts can never diverge. The frontend stores no verdicts; it renders what
Rust returns. The **Export Report** menu emits three fully-offline (no network, no
auth) share artifacts of the verdict: a **PNG card** (`snapshot.ts` rasterizes the
banner + table via `html-to-image` — fonts embedded + a warm-up render so the export
keeps Inter, white background hardcoded so it's never invisible; bytes written by the
`save_readiness_image` Rust sink), a **Markdown** summary copied to the clipboard
(`export/markdown.ts`, GFM table, "N/A" for unmeasured metrics — never fabricated),
and the original self-contained **HTML** one-pager (escaped, utf-8) to email a verdict
to a CTO. The image/Markdown builders are pure; the PNG path is the Phase 8 offline
share lever (see `process.md#phase-roadmap`, step 8.B4).

**Publishing to the community board (Phase 8 — privacy contract).** Separate from the
offline export, an *opt-in* publish path can contribute a verdict to a shared
leaderboard. What's sent is **verdicts + metrics, never content or context** — a
`PublishRow` per measured model, built by **allowlist** (only the named fields ship; a
new `ModelVerdict` field stays private until added to `project` on purpose): `model`,
`quant`, a **hardware `cohort_key`** (`{platform}/{accel}/{mem_tier}`, e.g.
`apple-silicon/m3-pro/32-64gb`), `tool_version`, the metrics bag (`pass_k`, `effort?`,
`avg_steps?`), and — since the **Phase 9 extension** — the graduated tier verdict
(`status`, `eval_method`, `tier_tested`, `cleared_tier`, `hardware_class`,
`recommended_tier`), the per-tier saturation curve (`by_tier`:
`{tier, pass_k_rate, k, avg_steps?, decoy_count?}`), the failure **distribution**
(`failure_distribution` — counts by mode incl. the new `reported_in_prose`, never the
failing runs), the collection identity (`collection_name` + a content `collection_hash`
so results compare only across an identical scenario set), build provenance
(`schema_version`, `engine_version`, `build_hash` — a short git commit from `build.rs`),
and the **inference `params`** the run used (temperature, top-p/k, max_tokens,
repeat_penalty, seed, num_ctx) so the board knows the sampling/context a `pass_k` was
measured under. The params are the **global-header** snapshot in effect at publish time
(the single source every run reads — architecture.md rule 7); only keys the user
actually set are sent (each field skip-serializes when unset), so an empty `{}` honestly
means "ran on the backend defaults" — never a fabricated value. **Never sent:** task
content, prompts, file names, raw model output, traces, verdict reasons, results on
**custom (non-built-in) collections** (dropped by the `collection_hash` gate), or any
identity beyond the GitHub handle. The payload is built in Rust
(`persistence/publish/` + `commands/publish/`), serialized to **deterministic
canonical JSON** (object keys sorted at every depth) and hashed (SHA-256, covering the
full extended row) so transit tampering is detectable; unmeasured/unquantized/
custom-collection rows are dropped (never sent as a null that would skew server
baselines), and the same plausibility checks the server runs are applied locally first
(`pre_validate`). The `PublishDialog` shows the **exact raw payload** and the
shared/never-shared breakdown behind a **default-OFF opt-in** before anything leaves the
machine. Results are **community-reported** — self-fabrication is
deterred (validation, outliers, GitHub identity, report/remove), not cryptographically
prevented. The closed backend (token authority, validation, dedup, leaderboard,
baselines) is a separate hosted repo; the desktop app is fully functional offline
without it. ⚠ The `cohort_key` taxonomy is **v1 pending backend sign-off** — the
server's bucketing must match it exactly or dedup `UNIQUE(user, model, quant,
cohort_key)` breaks.

*Auth + send.* The API base is resolved once from `QM_API_BASE`, defaulting to the live
production host `https://api.quantamind.co` (set `QM_API_BASE=http://localhost:8787` for
a local dev server). If the host is ever unreachable, the pre-flight probe below fails
fast with a clear message rather than hanging. Sign-in is OAuth
**PKCE** (no client secret): the app first runs a **pre-flight reachability probe**
(a ~5s-bounded GET to `/authorize`) so a stopped server fails *immediately* with
*"Can't reach the publish server — is it running?"* instead of hanging the 300s
loopback wait; then it opens the browser to `/authorize`, catches the loopback
redirect, and exchanges the code at `/token`. The **refresh token** is stored
**write-through**: always kept in an in-memory session copy *and* best-effort written to
the OS keychain (`keyring`) for cross-restart persistence. Reads prefer the session copy,
so once signed in this launch the keychain is never re-prompted — and a **denied or locked
keychain can never strand sign-in** (publishing keeps working for the session; sign-in
returns `persisted=false` and the UI warns you may need to sign in again next launch). On
macOS an **unsigned/dev build re-prompts on every keychain access** (the ACL can't bind to
a stable code identity, so "Always Allow" doesn't stick) — the production fix is code
signing + a keychain entitlement; the write-through vault makes it non-fatal meanwhile. To
fully reset auth, delete the `quantamind` / `publish-refresh` item in **Keychain Access**
and sign in again. A short-lived **access token** is cached in memory and silently
refreshed (rotating the refresh token). Publishing is **one batch = one request**: GET a fresh `/publish/nonce`,
recompute the canonical hash, POST `/publish` with the bearer token — a fresh nonce per
attempt (the server burns it on a 422). Every status maps to a typed outcome the UI
handles without freezing: `200`→toast + open board, `401`→re-auth, `422`→show the failing
row index, `426`→"please update", `429`→"try again shortly". On the **first** `401`/
`needs_auth` the UI opens sign-in and, once the token is stored, **auto-retries the
publish once** — no second click. A one-shot guard stops there: if it still needs auth
(sign-in cancelled/failed) the UI asks the user to Publish again rather than looping. An optional **write-up
link** may accompany a result but is restricted to an allow-list of dev/social hosts
(github.com, x.com, dev.to, reddit.com, medium.com, youtube.com, huggingface.co) to
keep the board from becoming a link farm. The whole auth/publish surface **compiles out
of enterprise/air-gapped builds** (cargo `enterprise` feature); the offline export does
not.

**The recommendation (the one-line answer).** `assess_readiness` returns the verdicts
**ranked best-first** (`readiness::recommend::rank`, also CLI-shareable) so the page
opens with a leaderboard and a **Recommendation banner**: *"Recommended for {profile}
on your hardware: **{model}** (Ready)."* The ranking key is **tier** (Ready >
Conditional > NotReady), then **effort** (`avg_output_tokens_success`, fewer tokens =
better), then **avg_steps** (fewer = better) — sourced **native-first**, the exact
aggregate the verdict gated on. It is float-safe by construction (`f64::total_cmp`,
unmeasured metrics map to `f64::MAX` and sink — never a `NaN` panic, never floating
above a measured model). When nothing qualifies the banner says **"No model is ready
for {profile} — closest: {model} ({reason})"** — never a fabricated Ready. (Latency,
`ms_per_step`, slots ahead of effort once the per-step timing is wired.)

## Resumable evaluation & VRAM isolation {#resumable-queue}

A multi-model sweep can run for hours; a sleep, an Ollama crash, or a force-quit must
not vaporize it, and two models must never stack in VRAM and OOM-lock the machine.
Phase 7.5 makes a batch **crash-resumable** and inserts a **hardware-enforced VRAM
gate**.

**The job log.** Every run writes an append-only `~/.config/quantamind/jobs/<collection>.jsonl`
— a header line (the full run config: targets, tasks, params) then one line per finished
`(model, task)` unit, appended atomically (`O(1)`, not a read-modify-write). The **native-FC
pass is a first-class citizen** (units tagged `is_native: true`), so an interrupted native
pass resumes too. The order is idempotent — *run → stream → append the outcome line* — so a
crash before the append just re-runs that one unit. A truncated final line (a hard crash
mid-write) is **healed**: the loader discards the unparseable tail rather than panic.

**VRAM isolation (assert-and-fail).** Between models, QuantaMind sends Ollama
`keep_alive: 0` to the previous model and **polls `/api/ps` until its `size_vram` is 0**
before loading the next. If the VRAM doesn't release within 30 s the run **halts** (the job
log stays intact for a later resume) — it never loads onto dirty VRAM, which is the exact
OOM it prevents. (Multi-model batches are Ollama-only; llama.cpp/MLX single-model servers
already reap deterministically via `kill` + `wait`.)

**Recovery.** On the Eval tab, if an interrupted run is found you're prompted to **Resume**
or **Discard**. Resume rebuilds the completed units into **one** partial report that paints
the Matrix instantly (no per-task event flood), then continues the live run, skipping
completed units. On a clean finish the report is **transactionally** persisted — saved,
verified on disk, and only **then** is the job log deleted — so a crash between the two can
never lose the run. At most the one in-flight `(model, task)` re-runs.
