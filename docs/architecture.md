# Architecture & Code Structure

Module boundaries, the dependency law (layering), the failure policy, and the
folder rules. Companion docs: `process.md` (how we work) and `reference.md`
(contracts + troubleshooting).

## Architecture

QuantaMind is a Tauri desktop app: React/TS frontend, Rust backend, JSON IPC,
HTTP to a local Ollama server.

### Module boundaries

**Frontend (`frontend/src/`)**

- `app/` — application shell, routing, providers. No feature logic.
- `features/<name>/` — self-contained vertical slice. Owns its components,
  hooks, state, types, schemas, and tests. Deletable in one `rm -rf`.
- `shared/ipc/` — only place that calls Tauri `invoke`. Typed wrappers.
- `shared/components/` — primitives reused by 2+ features. If only one
  feature uses it, it lives in that feature.

**Backend (`backend/src/`)**

- `commands/` — IPC entry points. Thin: validate, wire Tauri, delegate to a pure
  core. The **only** layer that names `tauri::` types. See [Layering](#layering).
  `run_prompt` is backend-aware (dispatches to Ollama or the `llama-server`
  sidecar per the request's `backend`); the workspace sidebar's backend list picks it.
  `commands/publish/` (Phase 8) holds the share/publish commands: `export_cmd` is a
  thin offline PNG sink (ships in every build); the auth + send surface
  (`auth`/`pkce`/`token`/`login_cmd`/`cohort`/`preview_cmd`/`publish_cmd`) is gated
  behind the `enterprise` cargo feature — `#[cfg(not(feature = "enterprise"))]` on the
  modules AND their `generate_handler!` entries — so it compiles OUT of enterprise/
  air-gapped builds. Auth uses PKCE (no client secret); the refresh token lives in the
  OS keychain (`keyring`) with an in-memory fallback when no secret service exists; the
  short-lived access token is the only managed `AuthState` (un-gated so `.manage()`
  works in every build). The pure, metrics-only canonical record + hash + local
  pre-validation live as a leaf in `persistence/publish/`.
- `inference/` — backend adapters behind the `InferenceBackend` trait
  (`backend.rs`). `OllamaBackend`, `LlamaCppBackend` (a `llama-server` sidecar),
  and `MlxBackend` (`mlx_lm.server`, Apple Silicon) today; callers build one by
  matching `BackendKind` (a closed enum — no `dyn`/`async-trait`). Cloud adds
  another variant. Both sidecar backends have an **app-managed lifecycle**: the
  app spawns/kills the server (`commands/{llama,mlx}/…start`), reaps children on
  exit (`commands/app_lifecycle.rs`), and the MLX server runs on a dynamic port
  resolved via `inference/mlx/server/mlx_endpoint.rs` — not a hardcoded `:8082`.
  **Tauri-free and must not import `crate::commands`** — when it must report
  progress it takes a sink trait (see [Layering](#layering)), not an `AppHandle`.
- `commands/stt/` + `inference/stt/` — **speech-to-text (whisper.cpp)**, an *additive
  parallel capability* that does not touch `InferenceBackend`/`run_prompt`. The STT
  engine is its own state axis, never derived from the LLM `BackendKind`.
  `commands/stt/` owns the `whisper-server` sidecar lifecycle: a fixed port `:8093`
  (clear of MLX's `8082..=8092` scan range) with **`/health`-gated readiness** — the
  server's own state machine answers HTTP 200 once the model is loaded, 503 while
  loading — graceful-then-hard kill, and reaping on exit alongside the LLM sidecars.
  Acquisition is atomic: `download_stt_model` stages the whisper ggml + the shared
  silero VAD, validates each, and promotes both-or-none; `reconcile_stt_dir` sweeps
  half-installs at startup. IPC: `start`/`stop_whisper_server`, `check_whisper_health`, `check_whisper_env`,
  `download_stt_model`, `cancel_stt_install`, `list_stt_catalog`,
  `list_installed_stt_models`. `inference/stt/` is the Tauri-free domain (curated catalog,
  ggml-format validation, the loopback-only offline probe so transcription never silently
  reaches the cloud). The engine binary is discovered most-explicit-first —
  `UserSettings.stt_engine_dir` → `QUANTAMIND_WHISPER_DIR` → PATH/Homebrew → bundled
  resources → dev tree — so a user's `brew install whisper-cpp` is found with no setup
  (mirrors `ollama_runtime::resolve_ollama`); `check_whisper_env` then `--help`-dry-runs it
  so "found" never masquerades as "runnable" when its dylibs are broken.
  `inference/stt/transcribe/` is the **transcription seam** (P1): decode WAV →
  downmix → resample to 16 kHz mono in Rust (`audio.rs`, hound + rubato) →
  one whisper-server `/inference` call per ~30 s window → stream segments through
  the Tauri-free `TranscribeSink` (parallel to `BatchSink`) → assemble the canonical
  `Transcript`. Engine choice is enum-dispatched (`SttTranscribeEngine`, no `dyn`).
  The artifact persists via `persistence/stt/transcripts.rs` (atomic; refuses an
  incomplete run). Every `TranscribeStats` field is `Option` (no fabricated metric).
  `inference/stt/profile/` is the **measurement layer** (P3): it fills `SttProfile`
  (every field `Option` → "N/A", never a guess). RTF = decoded sample-count seconds
  (`WindowReader::decoded_secs`, a hardware fact — not the container header) ÷ wall
  seconds (stopped on loop exit, before any finalize work). First-segment latency is
  the TTFT analog; the encode/decode split is `None` (whisper-server reports none).
  The **behavioral** fold (repeated-segment rate; word-level `Confidence`, `None`
  when the backend emits no probabilities; silence-hallucination) runs **off the
  timed path** on a `spawn_blocking` thread fed by a bounded channel, so its cost
  can't inflate RTF. Silence uses an **independent** `webrtc-vad` over the raw PCM
  (never the model's own `no_speech_prob` — that would be circular; an `assert_ne!`
  on the engine id enforces it). The `Profiler` is dropped (channel closed, thread
  drains) on any error `?`, so no partial profiling state lingers. The frontend
  renders it in the **Analysis & Inspector tabs** (`features/sttInspector`, fed by a
  durable `sttResultStore`) with the text-Inspector's N/A framing — see
  `reference.md#stt-inspector`.
  `inference/stt/eval/` is the **eval + readiness layer** (P4): a **dumb, decoupled
  scorer** over *stored* transcripts (it reads a `Transcript` JSON + an `eval_spec`,
  joins **by id**, and does math — it never owns transcription, so a sweep is
  reproducible and re-scorable in milliseconds). An `eval_spec` task is pure text
  (`{ id, reference: Option, critical_tokens }`); scoring goes through an `SttScorer`
  trait (`WerScorer` today — alignment WER + **critical-token-weighted** WER + a
  **misread flag** for confident substitutions, so a reader's slip on a read-aloud
  clip doesn't smear the model). `readiness.rs` mirrors the text pipeline: a **pure
  `assess()`** (reusing the `Readiness` enum + `MemoryProfile`) gates `min_rtf`
  (hard, explicit speed gate), `max_wer` (hard but **reference-gated** + keyed on the
  *weighted* WER for the financial/legal case — inert when WER is `None`, so "no
  reference" can neither pass nor fail on accuracy, only note "accuracy unverified"),
  behavioral soft conditions, and VRAM fit; `verdicts()` aggregates per model
  (means; a `None` never drags the mean). I/O is in `commands/stt/eval/` (the dumb
  runner streams one row at a time to a JSONL so a 1000-row sweep never holds every
  transcript/matrix); persistence leaves are `persistence/stt/eval_*`. Frontend:
  `features/sttEval/` in the Analysis tab.
  `commands/stt/transcribe.rs` is the **only** `AppHandle` seam: `transcribe_audio`
  streams segments to the UI (a `TauriTranscribeSink`) + persists; `write_scratch_wav`
  lands captured WAV bytes in a scratch dir (the returned path is the atomic
  ready-to-transcribe signal); `load_transcript` reloads the artifact. **Mic capture
  is native** (`commands/audio/capture.rs`, cpal) — WKWebView's `getUserMedia` is
  unreliable on macOS, so audio never touches the webview: `start_recording` runs the
  `!Send` cpal stream on its own thread, `recording_level` is polled for the live
  meter, `stop_recording` encodes the take (16-bit WAV at native rate — P1 resamples)
  into the scratch dir and reports `had_audio` so a silent take (muted mic / TCC
  denial, which records silence rather than erroring) surfaces "no audio detected".
  A micless machine maps to a clean "no microphone found" — CoreAudio hands back a
  phantom default input whose every query fails with an unknown OSStatus (e.g. a
  Mac mini with no mic), so the failure is classified by whether any input device
  exists, not by the opaque backend error.
  The macOS mic prompt is driven by `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in
  `backend/Info.plist`, embedded by Tauri's `generate_context!` (dev binary included).
  Frontend IPC mirrors the module in `shared/ipc/audio/capture.ts`
  (`features/sttWorkspace/hooks/useMicRecorder.ts` drives it). The Workspace
  **auto-routes to STT mode** (a live two-pane transcribe surface) while an STT
  server is running (`features/sttWorkspace/`); upload is path-based
  (WAV→hound, MP3→symphonia).
- `metrics/` — measurements: TTFT, tokens/sec, VRAM.
- `persistence/` — YAML/JSON read+write of prompts and history, plus `evals.rs`
  (custom tool-call eval collections: one `.json` per collection, name-sanitised,
  size-capped, validated on every read/write). The shared GGUF weights folder
  resolves via `UserSettings.models_folder` → `storage_disk::gguf_dir_resolved`
  (`UserSettingsState::weights_dir`); HF + local installs land there for
  llama.cpp and import into Ollama when reachable.
- `validation/` — schemas. Shared by commands and persistence.
- `errors.rs` — single `AppError` enum. No `unwrap()` outside tests.

### Rules

1. **One file = one concern.** If you need "and" to describe what a file
   does, split it.
2. **No cross-feature imports.** Features talk to each other only via
   `shared/` or via the backend.
3. **IPC is the only Rust/TS bridge.** No code-gen, no shared types file —
   keep contracts explicit in `shared/ipc/types.ts` and mirror in Rust.
4. **Validation at boundaries.** Zod on the TS side, `validator` + serde on
   the Rust side. Never trust IPC payloads.
5. **Errors are typed.** Rust returns `Result<T, AppError>`. TS returns
   discriminated unions, not thrown errors across IPC.
6. **Hooks for ephemeral, store for shared.** Per-action state that lives
   only as long as the action (mid-run output, install progress, ongoing
   fetch) belongs in a hook's local `useState`. Cross-component state read by
   parts of the UI that don't drive the action (current model, list of
   installed models, last run's final metrics) belongs in the Zustand store.
   Hooks may write to the store at completion; components must not read both
   the hook's local state and the store for the same piece of data — pick one
   source per piece of data.
7. **App-shell selection is global state in `shared/state/`.** The backend
   (`backendStore`), the model selection (`selectedModelStore`), and the inference
   parameters (`paramsStore`) define "what am I running and how" for the whole
   app, surfaced in the global header. They are not owned by any feature slice —
   a feature must not own state every other feature reads. The model selection is
   an array: Ollama is multi-select (2+ → a compare), llama.cpp/MLX single. The
   model list is filtered to the selected backend; switching backend reconciles
   the selection imperatively inside `setSelectedBackend` (trims off-backend
   models), never via a cross-store subscription. Every page reads this global
   selection — there is no per-page model picker (Eval keeps its own batch-target
   multi-select, filtered to the backend).

Update this section when a new top-level module is added, a boundary rule
changes, or the IPC contract gains a new category of message.

## Layering

How the backend modules depend on each other, and the two patterns that keep the
domain layer pure and testable. See [Architecture](#architecture) for the module
list and [Robustness](#robustness) for the failure policy.

### The dependency law

Edges point one way only. A lower layer must never import a higher one.

```
commands/  →  inference/  →  persistence/ , metrics/
   (IPC)        (domain)         (I/O)      (timing)
```

- `commands/` is the only layer that touches Tauri (`AppHandle`, `State`,
  `Emitter`, `#[tauri::command]`).
- **`inference/` must be Tauri-free.** It must not import `crate::commands`, and
  must not name any `tauri::` type. If domain code needs to report progress, it
  takes a **sink** (below), not an `AppHandle`.
- `persistence/` and `metrics/` are leaves: plain data in, `Result<T, AppError>`
  out, no knowledge of the layers above.

Enforced by a guardrail test (see [Robustness](#robustness)): no file under
`inference/` may contain `use crate::commands`.

### Pattern 1 — Sink boundary (invert the dependency)

When the domain must emit progress/results, it defines a **trait** describing the
events in plain domain terms; the IPC layer implements that trait by emitting
Tauri events. The domain depends on its own trait, never on the IPC layer.

```
inference/compare/sink.rs   pub trait CompareSink { fn token(..); fn done(..); … }
commands/compare.rs         impl CompareSink for TauriCompareSink { … app.emit(…) }
```

This is why `commands/` can know about `inference/` types but not the reverse.
The eval **batch dispatcher** follows the same shape: `inference/eval/batch.rs`'s
`run_batch` runs a strict sequential model×task queue (never fans out local
inference → OOM-safe) and emits through a `BatchSink`; `commands/eval/batch_cmd.rs`
implements it as `TauriBatchSink`, streaming `batch-progress`/`agentic-step`/
`batch-complete` over one channel so the IPC boundary is crossed once. The runner
is generic over a `ModelTurn` seam (real `BackendTurn` vs a scripted model), so the
whole queue is unit-tested without HTTP. On the frontend, the matching consumer
(`batchStore`) buffers events and flushes to reactive state at ≤60Hz via
`requestAnimationFrame`, so a model's token firehose never triggers a per-event
render.

The batch command also carries the **Phase-9 run-shape parameters** end-to-end:
`run_batch_eval` takes `tier`/`decoyTools` alongside `k`/`maxSteps`, persists them on
`RunConfig` (`#[serde(default)]` so older resumable job logs still parse), and
`apply_overrides` stamps them onto each agentic spec at run time (tier → `spec.tier`
+ derived `pass_k_for(tier)` when no explicit `k`; decoys → `spec.axes.decoy_tools`).
The eval page's tier-`Auto` mode + HW hint read a separate **`get_hardware_tier`**
command (`commands/eval/readiness_cmd.rs`) that classifies the machine via the
readiness engine's `classify_bytes` + `default_required_tier` — one source of truth
for the GB thresholds, never duplicated in TS.

On the **read** side (Phase 9B), the per-tier breakdown the Agent Report deep-dive
renders is computed once in `agg_agentic` (the enriched `TierStat` carries per-tier
`avg_steps` + `failures`) and surfaced on `ModelVerdict.by_tier`/`failures`. A single
`readiness::inputs::native_first_source` helper selects the native-first aggregate for
the gate, the per-tier breakdown, **and** the failure taxonomy, so the displayed numbers
can never come from a different pass than the verdict gated on.

### Pattern 2 — Thin command, pure core

A `#[tauri::command]` does three things only: validate input, wire Tauri
plumbing (build the sink/handler, manage `State`), and delegate to a pure
`*_inner` core. The core takes plain data + callbacks and is unit-testable
without a Tauri runtime.

Reference: `commands/prompt.rs` (thin) → `commands/prompt_run.rs::run_prompt_inner`
(pure, integration-tested with mockito). New commands follow this split; logic
that needs a test belongs in the core, not the command.

Update this section when the set of layers or allowed edges change, or a new
cross-layer boundary needs a sink/callback contract.

---

## Robustness

**No silent failures, no leaky data.** Every failure is either handled or
surfaced. The user (or a test, or a log) must be able to tell that something
went wrong. Fabricating a plausible-looking result is worse than an error,
because it hides.

### No silent failures

- **No `let _ =` on a fallible call** (a `Result`, a `JoinHandle`) unless it is a
  documented best-effort cleanup — and even then route it through a helper that
  logs the failure. For Tauri event emission use the `log_emit` helper, never a
  bare `let _ = app.emit(...)`: a dropped event silently freezes the UI.
- **Don't swallow serialization errors.** `serde_json::to_value(...)` and friends
  must log (or propagate) on failure, not vanish in an `if let Ok(_)`.
- **Observe spawned tasks.** Don't `let _ = join_all(handles)`; inspect each
  result and surface a panic/error as an event, not nothing.
- **Frontend: validation failures surface to state.** When a zod `safeParse`
  fails on an IPC payload, set an error state on the affected row/download (and
  log) — never `console.error` then `return`, which leaves the UI frozen. Promise
  rejections get a real handler, not a bare `.catch(() => {})`.

### No leaky data

- **Never fabricate data on error.** No zero-on-poison: a `token_count: 0` after a
  panic is indistinguishable from a real empty run. Emit a distinct
  degraded/error signal instead, so the UI can show "incomplete," not "done."
- **Don't blank error context.** `resp.text().await.unwrap_or_default()` turns an
  HTTP error body into "" — keep it (or annotate the read failure) so diagnostics
  survive.
- **Validate at every boundary.** zod on inbound IPC payloads (TS), `validator` +
  serde on inbound commands (Rust). Untrusted data never reaches domain logic
  unchecked.

### Independent panels degrade independently

A read that aggregates two independent sources must not fail wholesale when one
is down. `get_disk_usage` reports filesystem free/total (from `sysinfo`) plus a
model-bytes sum (from Ollama `/api/tags`). Ollama being unreachable zeroes only
the model sum (`disk_usage_for`) — it never fails the whole call, which used to
surface "Ollama is not running" inside the *Storage* panel. The zeroed sum is
not a leaky "done" signal: the Ollama-down state is shown distinctly by the
status bar and the installed-models list, so the user is never misled.

`clear_app_cache` (Downloads → **Clear cache**) deletes only regenerable caches
under `app_config_dir` via an explicit allow-list (`jobs/`, `history/`,
`batch_reports/`, `traces/`, `cliff/`, `recent_workspaces.yaml`) and returns the
measured bytes freed. Downloaded models, custom eval collections (`evals/`),
readiness profiles (`readiness/`), and settings are absent from the list, so a
clear can never destroy them. Logic lives in a pure `clear_cache_in(base)` core
(unit-tested over a tempdir); the thin command only resolves the config dir.

### Errors are typed

Rust returns `Result<T, AppError>`; TS returns discriminated unions over IPC, not
thrown errors. **No `unwrap()`/`expect()`/`.parent().unwrap()` outside tests** —
prove the invariant or return a typed error.

> Known limitation / future option: `AppError` variants are stringly-typed
> (`Inference(String)`), so io errno / HTTP status is flattened to a message.
> Enriching them is high-ripple and deferred; the discriminated-union-over-IPC
> shape is acceptable for now.

### Guardrail

A backend test enforces the layering invariant (no `use crate::commands` under
`inference/`) and flags any folder with >10 files (see
[Folder taxonomy](#folder-taxonomy)).

Update this section when a new class of failure or boundary appears, or the
error model changes (e.g. structured `AppError`).

---

## Folder taxonomy

One concern per file (see [Conventions](process.md#conventions)); and **no folder holds
more than 10 files**. When a folder reaches the limit, split it into sub-folders
grouped by concern — never a `misc/`/`utils/` catch-all. Finding a file should be
a matter of guessing the right concern folder.

Enforced by a guardrail test on each side (`backend/tests/layering_guard.rs`,
`frontend/src/__tests__/folderTaxonomy.test.ts`). `__tests__` dirs are exempt —
they mirror their source one-to-one, so their size is already bounded.

### Target sub-folder layout

These four folders exceeded the limit and are split as follows (the reorg lands
one folder per commit, behavior unchanged).

- **backend `commands/`** (was 36 files): `prompt/` · `compare/` · `models/` ·
  `hf/` · `gguf/` · `ollama/` · `workspace/` · `storage/` · `settings/` ·
  `system/` (health, feasibility, hardware, onboarding)
- **backend `inference/`** (was 33 files): `ollama/` · `llama/` · `mlx/`
  (wire + chunk + stats + stream + backend, plus `mlx/server/` =
  runtime/locate/stderr/endpoint for the launcher) · `gguf/` · `hf/` · `pull/` ·
  `create/` · `compare/` · `eval/` (deterministic mini-eval task + scoring, plus
  `eval/toolcall/` — prompt-based, single-turn, structural tool-call eval) ·
  `http/` (http + ndjson) · `backend/` (trait + kind) · `generate/` (spec +
  options) · `chat/` (templates) · `vram_math.rs` (canonical f16 KV-cache formula,
  unit-tested). `ollama/` also has `ollama_show.rs` — the Tauri-free `/api/show` client
  (template, capabilities, raw `model_info`) behind `commands/models/model_inspect.rs`
  (which also parses `ModelInspect.dims` + exposes `estimate_kv_cache_bytes`); frontend IPC
  in `shared/ipc/system/inspect.ts`. The Quant tab's KV-aware VRAM fit / OOM gate lives in
  `features/quant` (`useVramFit`, `QuantPage`, `fit.ts::fitOfNeed`); the curated memory-bandwidth
  lookup is in `commands/system/hardware_mem.rs`. The 5.12–5.15 diagnostics are mostly frontend over
  data already fetched: `features/eval/CpuFallbackBanner` (silent CPU fallback, from `/api/ps`),
  `QuantPage::toolcallDelta` (quant parse-rate delta), `features/inspector/ContextBudgetBar`
  (prompt_eval_count / context_length), and the context-cliff probe (`features/eval/cliff.ts` +
  `useContextCliff` + `ContextCliffChart`, visx). Built-in eval presets (curated + `tasks_finance.json`)
  are enumerated by `toolcall/tasks.rs::BUILTIN_COLLECTIONS` behind `list_builtin_collections` /
  `get_builtin_collection`.
- **backend `inference/eval/agentic/`** (was 11 files): the run-judgment concern
  splits into `agentic/scoring/` (`report.rs` = `AgenticReport`/`FailureTracker`/
  `FailureKind`/`RunOutcome`/`TopError`; `endstate.rs` = `checkpoint_matches` /
  `validate_call`). The run loop (`runner`, `model_turn`, `context`, `step`),
  task definition (`spec`, `sandbox`, `build`) stay at the root. **`agentic/v2/`** is
  the Phase 9-v2 authored-scenario engine: `collection`/`transpile` (load a v2 JSON
  object → engine `ToolTask`s), `match` (wildcard + `must_not_call`), `world_state`
  (ground-truth responder), `scenarios` (the 19 bundled collections via
  `include_str!`, under `v2/scenarios/`), and `generator` (per-run procedural
  instancing — seeded entity-id remap). v2 runs on the SAME runner — no second
  execution path (`run_agentic_with` drives Pass^k via a per-run sandbox factory).
- **frontend `features/workspace/components/`** (was 17 files): `model-select/` ·
  `prompt/` (editor + params) · `run/` (single/multi + controls + output) ·
  `status/` (status bar, ollama control, errors)
- **frontend `shared/ipc/`** (was 26 files), grouped by domain: `core/` (client,
  error, errorInfo, timeout, types) · `events/` (event names + payload zod
  schemas) · `compare/` · `models/` · `workspace/` · `settings/` · `system/` ·
  `eval/` (`evals`, `toolcall`, `registry` — the custom-eval CRUD + ToolTask zod)
- **custom-eval registry** spans the layers by responsibility: the storage-free
  runner takes a `Vec<ToolTask>`; `persistence/evals.rs` owns file I/O;
  `commands/eval/eval_registry.rs` is the thin CRUD + path-only import; UI lives
  in `features/eval/` (`useEvalRegistryStore`, whose `NEW_COLLECTION` sentinel /
  `startNew` model the unsaved-new selection). The manager UI is a master-detail
  split under `components/manager/` (`EvalManager` orchestrator + `NameDialog`,
  `TaskListView`, `TaskDetailView`, `StatsBar`) — kept in a subfolder so
  `components/` stays ≤10 files — over feature-root modules `evalDraft.ts` (draft
  shape + Save/Run validation) and `verdict.ts` (pass/fail + score helpers, shared
  with `ToolCallPanel`).
- **collection matrix & history** follows the same layering: pure aggregation in
  `inference/eval/toolcall/matrix.rs` (`build_matrix`/`summaries`, no async/I/O);
  the append-only, 100-entry-capped log in `persistence/eval_history.rs`; the thin
  sequential runner + history write in `commands/eval/matrix_cmd.rs`
  (`run_collection_matrix`/`load_collection_history`). UI is a separate
  `components/matrix/` subfolder (`MatrixPanel` + `MatrixGrid`, `HistoryTimeline`,
  `ModelToggles`) mounted in `EvalPage`, over `shared/ipc/eval/matrix.ts`.
- **pipeline visualizer** reuses the runner's single-task path: `eval.rs` exposes
  `trace_one` (+ `TraceResult` = system message + raw output + verdict), which
  `run_eval` loops over and the `trace_toolcall_task` command calls directly — so
  the trace matches a real run. UI is a `components/pipeline/` subfolder
  (`PipelinePanel` + `ConfigPhase`, `SystemMessagePhase`, `StreamPhase`,
  `VerifyPhase`) over `traceToolcallTask` in `shared/ipc/eval/toolcall.ts`.
- **trace cache** keeps a run's per-task traces so a drill-down never re-runs
  inference: `run_eval_traced` (in `eval.rs`) returns the full `TaskTrace`s
  alongside the report, and both runners (`run_toolcall_eval` Simulator,
  `run_collection_matrix`) cache them best-effort into the `traces/` managed dir
  via `persistence/eval_trace_store.rs` (one JSON file per collection, models
  keyed within, upsert by task id, 1 MB read guard). `load_toolcall_trace`
  serves a cached `(collection, model, task)` trace; `PipelinePanel` loads it on
  a `View Trace` / Matrix-cell handoff (▶ still re-runs live). A cache miss/write
  failure degrades gracefully to a live run — never blocks the eval.

### Rules for a split

- Move files only; do not change behavior in a reorg commit.
- Update the module's `mod.rs` (Rust) / import paths (TS); run the full suite
  green before committing.
- Keep tests beside their code through the move.

Update this section when a folder crosses 10 files and needs a new sub-grouping,
or a sub-folder's concern boundary changes.

### Rationale

- **`frontend/` + `backend/` top split.** Two languages, two toolchains.
  Co-locating each side's configs with its source means a frontend dev rarely
  needs to read backend files and vice versa.
- **`features/` over `components/` at top level.** Each feature is a vertical
  slice: components + hooks + state + tests. Deletable in one `rm -rf`.
- **`commands/` mirrors `features/`.** Every command corresponds to a frontend
  need. If they drift, something is wrong.
- **`__tests__/` next to code.** Rust integration tests are the exception —
  they live in `backend/tests/` because cargo requires it.

### Tauri CLI: pointing at `backend/`

Tauri 2's CLI discovers the project by searching subfolders of cwd for
`tauri.conf.json`. From `frontend/` it can't see `backend/`, so
`frontend/package.json`'s `tauri` script is `"cd .. && tauri"` — shifting cwd to
the QM-Dev root where `backend/` is a subfolder. `backend/tauri.conf.json` then
references the frontend via `pnpm --dir=../frontend dev` / `build` and
`frontendDist: ../frontend/dist`. Both directions of the hop are explicit.

New work almost never adds a top-level folder; it fits into a new feature
(`frontend/src/features/<name>/`) or a new command + domain module.
