# Working on QuantaMind

The locked tech stack, day-zero setup, conventions, the mandatory per-step
workflow, the data-quality gate, the phase roadmap, and deferred ideas.
Companion docs: `architecture.md` and `reference.md`.

## Tech stack

Locked decisions. Do not substitute. Alternatives go to
[Future considerations](#future-considerations).

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2.x | 30MB binary, native WebView, Rust backend |
| Backend language | Rust (stable, ed. 2021) | Tauri default, safe IPC + HTTP |
| Frontend framework | React 18 + TS 5.x | Largest open-source contributor pool |
| Build tool | Vite 5.x | Fast HMR, Tauri-friendly |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3.x | Utility-first, no design-system overhead |
| State management | Zustand | 1KB, no boilerplate, scales |
| Editor component | `@monaco-editor/react` | Same editor as VS Code |
| HTTP client (Rust) | `reqwest` + `tokio` | Standard, battle-tested |
| Serialization | `serde` + `serde_json` / native JSON | Type-safe across IPC |
| Validation (TS) | `zod` | Runtime schema validation |
| Validation (Rust) | `validator` + `serde` | Type-level + custom validators |
| Testing (Rust) | `cargo test` + `mockito` | Built-in, no setup |
| Testing (TS) | `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` | Fast, Vite-native |
| E2E | Playwright | Cross-platform |
| CI | GitHub Actions | Free for open source |
| Format | `rustfmt` + Prettier | Auto-format on save |
| Lint | Clippy + ESLint | Catch problems pre-runtime |
| Pre-commit | lefthook | Lighter than Husky |

Phase 3 additions (locked; installed when their step lands):

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Word diff (TS) | `diff-match-patch` | De-facto standard for word-level diffs; tiny, dependency-free. |
| Secret storage (Rust) | `keyring` | OS-native keychain for cloud API keys — never plaintext on disk. |
| llama.cpp backend | `llama-server` (Tauri sidecar binary) | Local GGUF inference over HTTP, mirroring the Ollama path. Subprocess, not in-process FFI. |
| STT engine (Phase 0) | `whisper-server` (whisper.cpp `server` example; bundled sidecar) | Local speech-to-text over HTTP on `:8093`, mirroring the `llama-server` lifecycle; reuses the bundled `libggml-*` dylibs. Subprocess, not FFI. State-aware `/health`; silero VAD bundled with each model. |
| STT audio preprocessing (P1/P2) | `hound` (WAV) + `symphonia` (MP3/others, P2 upload) + `rubato` (resample) + `reqwest` `multipart` | Decode audio → downmix → resample to 16 kHz mono **in Rust** (explicit, logged) → POST per ~30 s window to whisper-server `/inference` (`verbose_json`). Pure-Rust, not FFI; lets the seam stream + bound memory + assert the resample/duration in our own code. WAV-first; `symphonia` (compressed formats) deferred. |
| STT Inspector VAD (P3) | `webrtc-vad` | The silence-hallucination metric needs an **independent** voice-activity detector over the raw 16 kHz PCM — never the STT model's own opinion, or the metric is circular. WebRTC VAD is deterministic, non-ML (energy/SBC), negligible CPU, loads no model. Its `Vad` C handle is `!Send`, so the profiling fold runs on a `spawn_blocking` thread. Distinct from whisper-server's bundled silero VAD (which lives inside the decode path). |

Phase 4 additions (locked; installed when their step lands):

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Charting (TS) | `visx` v4 (`@next`, scale/shape/group) | React-19-native (stable v3 pins React ≤18). Modular SVG primitives for the Inspector charts; we draw axes/legends ourselves. Pin the alpha until v4 ships stable. |

### What is explicitly NOT installed (yet)

- Logging library — use `println!` / `console.log` until Phase 2.
- State-machine library — Zustand is enough.
- UI component library — Tailwind utility classes only.
- Form library — no forms in Phase 1.
- AI/ML libraries — we do not run models in-process. We call Ollama, and a
  bundled `llama-server` sidecar over HTTP — never FFI.

Resist additions. Every dependency is a maintenance debt. Update this section
only when a locked choice is replaced (requires a PR with rationale) or a new
layer is added.

## Conventions

### Naming

| Domain | Style | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Rust functions / vars | `snake_case` | `run_prompt` |
| Rust types | `PascalCase` | `InferenceBackend` |
| Rust constants | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| TS functions / vars | `camelCase` | `runPrompt` |
| TS components / types | `PascalCase` | `PromptEditor` |
| TS constants | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| React component file | `PascalCase.tsx` | `PromptEditor.tsx` |
| TS non-component file | `kebab-case.ts` | `use-streaming-run.ts` |
| Rust file | `snake_case.rs` | `ollama.rs` |
| Branch | `phase-N/feature-name` | `phase-1/streaming-output` |

### Commits — Conventional Commits

`feat:` new user-visible behavior · `fix:` bug fix · `chore:` tooling/deps/config
· `docs:` documentation only · `test:` adding/fixing tests · `refactor:` no
behavior change. One step = one commit (or a tight related series). PR title
matches the convention; PR body references "closes #N" when applicable.

### File size

- **Keep each file single-concern.** There is no hard line-count limit; split a
  file when it starts doing *two things*, not when it crosses a number. Splits
  are by responsibility, never by halving. (The ≤10-files-per-folder taxonomy
  rule still holds — see `architecture.md#folder-taxonomy`.)

### Comments

- Default: write none. Naming + structure carry the meaning.
- Write a one-line comment only when the *why* is non-obvious (a workaround, a
  subtle invariant, a constraint not visible in the code).
- Never reference tickets, callers, or "I added this for…".

### Errors

- Rust: `Result<T, AppError>` only. No `unwrap()` outside tests.
- TS: discriminated unions returned across IPC. No thrown errors over the IPC
  boundary.

### Tests

- Live next to code: `__tests__/` in TS, inline `#[cfg(test)]` in Rust,
  integration in `backend/tests/`.
- Name tests after the behavior, not the function: `streams_tokens_in_order`
  not `test_run_prompt`. One behavior per test.

### Colors & imports

- All colors flow through the theme tokens in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`.
  Use Tailwind palette classes (token-backed) or the `surface`/`ink` semantic
  colors. No hardcoded hex outside `tokens.css`.
- Absolute imports for cross-feature in TS (`@/shared/...`); relative within a
  feature. Rust: prefer `use crate::module::...` over deep relative paths.

---

## Workflow

The single most important section in the repo. Follow it literally — one step
at a time.

For every unit of work (one step, one ticket, one feature slice):

```
[1] Understand the step
    └─ Read the spec from the roadmap or the user message.
    └─ Write down expected input and expected output BEFORE writing any code.

[2] Implement the minimum
    └─ Smallest code change that could satisfy the spec.
    └─ No speculative abstractions. No "while I'm here" cleanup.

[3] Write the test
    └─ One test per behavior. Name it after the behavior, not the function.
    └─ Tests live next to code: src/.../__tests__/ or backend/tests/.

[4] Run the test
    └─ It must pass. If it does not, fix the code (not the assertion).

[5] Verify the output (DATA QUALITY GATE)
    └─ A green test is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT.
    └─ Print/log the actual output. Eyeball it.
    └─ Does it match expected shape? types? values? edge cases?
    └─ See the Data quality section for the full checklist.

[6] Update docs
    └─ If behavior changed, update the section that describes it.

[7] Commit
    └─ Conventional Commits. One step = one commit (or a tight series).

[8] Move on
    └─ Only now is the next step allowed to begin.
```

### Common violations (do not do these)

- **Stacking steps.** "Let me knock out steps 1–3 then test." → No. Test after
  each one.
- **Loosening assertions to make tests pass.** If `assert_eq 42` fails because
  the output is 41, do not change to `assert > 40`. Fix the code.
- **Skipping verification because the test passed.** Tests verify the path you
  wrote; verification confirms the path was the right one.
- **Bundling docs into "I'll update them later."** Later does not exist.
- **Refactoring during a feature.** Open a separate branch/commit.

### Stop conditions

Stop and ask the user if a step's spec is ambiguous, the data-quality gate fails
and the fix would change the spec, a file's concern boundary is unclear and the
split is non-obvious, or a test requires hardware that may not be present.

---

## Data quality

A passing test only means the code executed the path you described. Data quality
means the *output* is actually correct. Both gates must pass before a step is
done.

Tests lie when: mocks return canned values matching the assertion but not
reality; assertions check `result != null` but not contents; the function
returns the right type with wrong values; streaming emits tokens in the wrong
order/encoding/count; persistence "succeeds" but writes corrupted YAML.

### The verification checklist

After every green test, run through this:

1. **Shape** — Is the type what you expected (string vs object vs array)? Are
   required fields present, no surprise fields added? For streams: count of
   chunks, ordering, terminator behavior.
2. **Values** — Sample the actual values; in reasonable ranges? Numeric units
   correct (ms vs s, bytes vs MB)? Strings UTF-8, no BOM, no escape leaks?
   Timestamps correct timezone, monotonic where required?
3. **Edge cases** — Empty input → empty output (not crash/null). Very large
   input → handled or rejected with a clear error. Unicode/emoji/RTL → preserved.
   Malformed input → typed error, not a panic.
4. **Cross-boundary fidelity** — Rust → JSON → TS: does the field round-trip
   (snake_case vs camelCase!)? Disk → memory: YAML reloads byte-identical? Partial
   reads / disconnections handled?
5. **Determinism (where applicable)** — Same input → same output? If not, is the
   non-determinism documented?

### How to verify, and when it fails

- Print the output and read it; do not skim. For streams, dump first/last N
  chunks to a file. For persistence, `diff` the round-trip against the original.
  For IPC, log both sides and compare.
- When verification fails: do NOT relax the test — it was right. Fix the
  producing code and add a regression test. If the spec was wrong, update the
  spec AND the test together.
- Logging: verbose `println!` / `console.log` during development is fine; remove
  or gate behind a debug flag before commit. Never commit logs containing prompt
  content or user data.

## Phase roadmap

Where each phase begins and ends. Workflow per step is in [Workflow](#workflow)
(implement → test → verify output → docs → commit).

### Phase 1 — v0.1.0 (shipped)

Day-zero usable single-prompt workspace. Tests: 67 backend + 336 frontend
passing.

### Phase 2 — v0.2 Daily-driver polish (complete)

Turns v0.1 into a daily driver: prompts on disk, every inference knob exposed,
auto-rerun on save, error states that tell you what to do, ships on Windows +
Linux, keyboard-first coverage. Workspaces ship first so params, history, and
auto-rerun all attach to a real "current prompt file" from day one.

| # | Step | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.4 | Workspaces & files | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.1 | Parameter controls | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.2 | Auto-rerun on save | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.3 | Prompt history | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.5 | Better error states | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.7 | Light + system theme | done (dark values need visual tuning) |
| 2.6 | Onboarding | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.10 | Keyboard shortcuts | done (pending live GUI check) |
| 2.8 | Windows + Linux builds | done (CI authored; needs a tag run) |
| 2.9 | Auto-update polish | done (pending live GUI check) |

Locked decisions: workspaces are folders of `*.quantamind.yaml` files (no
tauri-plugin-sql); hotkeys are a hand-rolled `useHotkey` (no new dep); Windows
ships unsigned in 2.8 (cert deferred to [Future considerations](#future-considerations)).
Never add in Phase 2: browser-based inference, team features, cloud sync
(multi-model comparison already shipped in v0.1).

Step-level acceptance gate (each step "done" only when all true): code merged
behind a `phase-2/<step>` PR; full Vitest + cargo suites green; output verified
per [Data quality](#data-quality); relevant docs updated in the same commit;
files single-concern (≤10 per folder); locked stack honored.

**Phase 2.4 complete** — backend 95 lib + 2 lifecycle integration; frontend 361
(11 new for workspaces). Verified via `workspace_lifecycle.rs` (round-trip, tree
order, rename/delete, hidden-dir skip, human-readable YAML). Not yet exercised in
a live Tauri window (folder picker needs a GUI + display).

### Phase 3 — v0.3 "The Bench" (complete)

A dedicated model-comparison Bench: per-panel params, output diff, metrics, saved
configs, and prompt templates.

Steps 3.1–3.3 done: the `InferenceBackend` trait, the llama.cpp `llama-server`
sidecar backend, and a left **backend switcher** that scopes the Workspace to
Ollama or llama.cpp. Steps 3.4–3.9 done: a dedicated **Bench** tab with
seq/parallel + VRAM gate, word-level diff, metric bar charts, saved
`*.bench.yaml` configs, a quantamind.co report footer, and a bundled
prompt-template library.

**Step 3.10 (cloud baseline) is dropped from Phase 3.** The
`InferenceBackend`/`BackendKind` design stays open to a cloud variant (see the
forward-looking notes in `inference/backend/`), so a future phase can add it
without rework. With 3.10 out of scope, Phase 3 ships at 3.1–3.9 and is complete.

### Phase 4 — v0.4 "The Inspector" (complete)

Performance instrumentation: surface the raw timing/memory signal behind a run
so users can see *why* it was fast or slow. Built one step at a time.

- **4.1 Per-token timing instrumentation (done).** `RunTiming` records a
  `TokenTiming { text, t_ms, n }` per accepted token (`t_ms` = ms since run
  start, monotonic; `n` = 1-based count). The `prompt-done` event's
  `DonePayload` gains a `timeline` array, mirrored by the frontend zod schema.
  The first entry's `t_ms` equals `ttft_ms` by construction. Foundation for the
  views below; no UI yet.
- **4.2 Token-timeline chart (done).** New **Inspector** tab plots the last
  run's per-token latency (x = token index, y = gap from previous token) with
  the TTFT bar annotated and latency-spike gaps flagged as outliers (robust
  median/MAD modified-z rule). Pure math in
  `features/inspector/format/timeline.ts`; rendered with `visx` v4 (`@next`).
  Driven off `compareStore.rows`, so it shows **one labeled chart per model**
  for both single and multi-model runs (Compare now carries a per-token
  `timeline` on its done event). Hovering a bar shows a `#index · ms — token`
  readout.
- **4.3 TTFT breakdown (done).** `generate` now returns a `GenerateStats` from
  each backend's final chunk (Ollama's `load_duration`/`prompt_eval_*`/`eval_*`,
  ns→ms; llama.cpp's `timings`), carried on the done payloads. The Inspector
  shows a stacked TTFT bar per model — Model load + Prompt prefill +
  Network/first-token (remainder) — segmented only by what the backend reports;
  otherwise "not available". Pure math in `features/inspector/format/ttft.ts`.
- **4.4 VRAM allocation (done).** `get_loaded_models` reads Ollama `/api/ps`;
  the Inspector shows a per-model bar — In VRAM (`size_vram`) vs offloaded to
  system RAM (`size − size_vram`), `context_length` in the tooltip. Models not
  loaded / non-Ollama backends → "Not available" (never a fabricated
  weights/KV/free split). Device free/total VRAM deferred to 4.5 (GPU probe).
- **4.5 Hardware detection (done).** CPU/cores/RAM/OS/arch via `sysinfo` + a
  shell-out GPU probe (`nvidia-smi` CSV → bytes; macOS `sysctl` chip name +
  unified memory; else "Not available") in a new **Settings › Hardware** view.
- **4.6 Inter-token latency histogram (done).** Per-model visx histogram of the
  inter-token gaps; outlier bins highlighted (`format/histogram.ts`).
- **4.7 Cold- vs warm-start (done).** `HistoryEntry` records ttft/tok-s/load_ms;
  the Inspector compares cold (load_ms>500ms) vs warm runs per model and shows
  the cold-load TTFT delta (`format/coldwarm.ts`).
- **4.8 Memory-leak heuristic (done).** `get_ollama_rss` (sysinfo processes)
  sampled per run into a session series; a banner flags a monotonic climb across
  5 runs (`format/leak.ts`).
- **4.9 Regression alerts (done).** Per model, the latest run is compared to the
  rolling 7-day average of prior same-prompt runs (from history); a ≥20% tok/s
  drop is flagged (`format/regression.ts`).
- **4.10 HTML report (done).** A self-contained inline-SVG/HTML report (hardware,
  per-model metrics, TTFT/VRAM bars, timeline + histogram, cold/warm +
  regression) exported via the dialog + `save_compare_report` (now allows
  `html`). Builders in `features/inspector/report/`.

**Phase 4 (v0.4 The Inspector) is complete (4.1–4.10).** Metrics stay nullable
(`null` = not measured, never `0`); reports follow
[#analysis-schema](reference.md#analysis-schema). Tests: full `cargo test`
green + `cargo clippy` error-free; 560 frontend (vitest) + `tsc`; `pnpm build`
succeeds. Shipped on branch `phase-4/per-token-timing`. Live GUI verification
pending (same gate as earlier phases).

### Phase 5 — v0.5 Quantization & Backends (complete)

Broaden *which* models and backends users can run, and help them pick the right
one. Built one step at a time.

- **5.1 MLX inference backend (done; live-verified).** A `MlxBackend` streams from
  `mlx_lm.server`'s OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` (SSE), reached over
  HTTP — no FFI, consistent with the locked stack. **Apple Silicon only.**
  mlx_lm is user-installed (`pip install mlx-lm`), not bundled; QuantaMind only
  health-probes it read-only via `GET /v1/models` and shows MLX in the workspace
  backend rail only on Apple Silicon. `BackendKind::Mlx` listens on `:8082`
  (mlx_lm defaults to `:8080`, which collides with llama-server — launch with
  `--port 8082`). Wire mapping: `num_predict→max_tokens`, `top_k→top_k`,
  `repeat_penalty→repetition_penalty`; **`seed` is dropped** (mlx_lm has no seed
  field, so MLX runs are **not seed-reproducible**). Stats are token counts only
  (all `*_ms` stay `None` — mlx_lm reports no per-phase timing); TTFT and
  tokens/sec come from the client-side `RunTiming`. Sub-steps: 5.1.1 enum +
  endpoint + dispatch; 5.1.2 wire request; 5.1.3 stats; 5.1.4 stream + backend;
  5.1.5 cancellation; 5.1.6 health command + Apple-Silicon gate; 5.1.7 frontend
  rail + gating + not-detected hint; 5.1.8 docs; 5.1.9 model discovery — the
  loaded model is listed via `GET /v1/models` (a third source alongside Ollama
  and llama.cpp) so MLX is selectable and runnable; size/quant aren't reported
  by that endpoint, so they show blank rather than a fabricated `0`.
- **5.2 Model fit + MLX launcher (done).** Two parts. **5.2A:** hardware-fit
  badges on the HF download table — green "Fits" / amber "Tight" / red "Won't
  fit" per variant from `features/models/fit.ts` (the compare feature's
  1.3×-safety, 70%-tight rule); the column is omitted, never guessed, when no
  hardware snapshot. **5.2B:** QuantaMind now **starts `mlx_lm.server`** for a
  user-chosen HF repo (the dropdown-driven flow), reversing 5.1's "no in-app
  start" — `mlx_lm.server --model <repo>` downloads the repo on launch, so this
  is download + run in one flow. It mirrors the llama-server lifecycle with
  three hardenings: (1) **no false-fail** — start returns immediately, a stderr
  reader thread reports `Downloading`/`Starting`, readiness is the health probe
  (never a timeout during a multi-minute download), and `mlx_server_status`
  surfaces a died process's stderr tail; (2) **exit-reap** —
  `RunEvent::ExitRequested` kills the child (also llama-server) so no zombie
  holds memory/port; (3) **dynamic port** — `find_available_port(8082..=8092)`
  picks a free port stored in a process-global, and the MLX endpoint is
  state-derived (`mlx_endpoint()`), so health/discovery/dispatch follow it (no
  hardcoded `:8082`). Set `QUANTAMIND_MLX_SERVER` to override the executable
  path. (AWQ variants + resumable multi-file pulls deferred.)
- **5.3 Quantization comparison (done).** On the **Quant** tab, a chosen model's
  installed quants compare side-by-side: **size** + hardware **fit** (static),
  and **quality** = the 5.4 eval suite run per variant → a per-quant pass-rate
  (a variant whose backend errors is marked "error", never a misleading 0). A
  **"Compare speed in Bench →"** button loads the variants into the compare
  store and jumps to the Bench for **speed/TTFT/VRAM** (reusing the existing
  backend-aware compare runner from 5.6 rather than rebuilding metrics).
- **5.4 Built-in mini-eval suite (done).** Bundled `docs/evals/*.yaml` tasks
  (classification, reasoning, extraction, schema) run against any installed
  model from the **Eval** tab → a pass-rate + per-task pass/fail. **Scoring is
  deterministic** (locked stack has no sandbox/judge): exact-match,
  multiple-choice (first whole-word choice token), and — for the "code"
  category — **JSON schema-conformance** (BFCL-style): a balanced-brace
  extractor finds the first object that parses, then a flat depth-1 check of
  required keys + top-level types. Honest framing: a quality *smoke test*, not a
  rigorous benchmark. `inference/eval` (pure scoring, Tauri-free) + `commands/eval`
  (`list_evals`, `run_eval_task` — runs temp-0, accumulates output, scores).
- **5.5 Smart quant recommender (done).** A **Quant** tab: pick a model that has
  several installed quantizations (grouped by family + size in `quantPick.ts`)
  and a use case (fast-chat / quality-writing / coding / reasoning) → a
  recommended quant + plain-language why. Pure `recommendQuant` combines the
  `HardwareSnapshot` fit (reusing `memoryFit`'s 1.3× rule) with a quant-quality
  rank: fast-chat picks the smallest fitting quant, quality use-cases the
  highest-quality one; honest when nothing fits or hardware is unknown.
- **5.6 Backend auto-selection (done).** A backend is **coupled to the model's
  weight format** — an MLX model runs only on MLX, a GGUF only on
  llama.cpp/Ollama — so selection is the absolute `model.backend` mapping, never
  a health-based fallback. Compare rows are now **backend-aware** (`rows_for`
  takes a backend per model; `run_compare` forwards each model's backend, so a
  mixed-backend compare dispatches each row to the right server — previously all
  rows wrongly went to Ollama). When the required backend isn't healthy, Run is
  **blocked with a hint** ("Start the MLX backend to run this model") rather than
  rerouting (`features/workspace/state/runHint.ts`).
- **5.7 Model card viewer (done).** Real READMEs are arbitrary HTML, so the card
  is treated as a **data source, not a document**: `hf_model_card` fetches the
  README and `to_card` reduces it to structured data — `license`, `base_model`,
  `pipeline_tag`, `tags` (parsed from the YAML frontmatter via the existing
  `serde_yaml`, handling string-or-list shapes) + a `description` (the first ~3
  prose paragraphs, skipping HTML/tables/headings). The frontend
  `ModelCardDetail` maps that JSON to **native components** — badges, a tag list,
  the description, and an **"Open full card on Hugging Face →"** button (shell).
  Crash-proof by construction (controlled values, never injected HTML); 404 →
  "no model card", not an error.
- **5.8 Tool-calling reliability eval (done).** The agentic sibling of 5.4: which
  model/quant/backend can drive an agent, measured **offline, deterministically,
  judge-free**. **Prompt-based** (tool schemas in the system message, parse the
  JSON call from the completion — backend-agnostic), **single-turn**, **greedy
  (temp 0)**. Scoring is **BFCL-style structural** (name + structural args, not
  execution) over a curated ~13-task fixture (single / select / parallel /
  abstain), labelled *indicative, prompt-based, structural*. Two metrics kept
  separate via **cascaded conditional denominators** so a format error doesn't
  bleed into reasoning: `parse_rate` (over call-expected tasks), `tool_selection`,
  `args`, `abstain` — each `Option` (n/a, not 0, on a 0 denominator); composite =
  mean of available. The greedy extractor handles arrays AND bare sequential
  objects; parallel scoring is length-guarded 1:1. Surfaced on the **Eval** tab
  (`ToolCallPanel`) and as a per-quant spread in the **Quant** view.
  `inference/eval/toolcall/` (Tauri-free). The per-quant spread is a one-line
  headline in the **Quant** view (e.g. `Q4_K_M 71% · Q8_0 88%`).

- **5.9 Custom-eval manager (done).** The suite is dynamic: run the curated
  built-in set **or** your own authored collections. The runner is
  **storage-decoupled** — `run_toolcall_eval(model, backend, tasks)` is always
  handed a `Vec<ToolTask>` (built-in via `get_builtin_tasks`, or a loaded
  collection) and never touches files. Collections are one **`.json` per file**
  under `app_config_dir/evals/` (portable, VCS-friendly), with Rust-owned CRUD +
  a **path-only import** (`import_custom_collection(source_path)` reads, size-caps
  at 1 MiB, and validates — the frontend never reads file bytes across IPC).
  **`validate_tasks` is the single backend-side trust boundary** for *any* task
  source (built-in, saved, imported, hand-edited): non-empty tools, known
  category, a JSON-Schema `parameters` block (validated via a strict serde
  struct), category⇔`expected` coherence, and calls only to offered tools — bad
  input → `AppError::InvalidTaskSchema` naming the field. Authoring is a plain
  textarea + **Insert Example** (one task per shape) + **Check JSON** (Zod, UX
  only). `tools[].parameters` adopts the nested **JSON-Schema** shape developers
  paste from real tool defs. `commands/eval/eval_registry.rs` +
  `persistence/evals.rs`; UI in `features/eval/` (`DatasetBar`, `EvalEditor`,
  `useEvalRegistryStore`).

- **5.10 Model inspector + template/base-model guard (done).** Local diagnostics
  from Ollama's `/api/show`: the chat **template** (rendered as inert text, never
  injected HTML), the reported **capabilities**, and an **advisory base-model
  guess** — flagged when the template has no chat-role markers AND `tools` isn't a
  capability, with the **evidence** surfaced (`base_reason`) so it reads "likely
  base — …", not an absolute claim. **Ollama-only** (the data lives in `/api/show`);
  other backends show "Not available — Ollama only". `inference/ollama/ollama_show.rs`
  (Tauri-free client; raw `model_info` kept for the 5.11 KV predictor) +
  `commands/models/model_inspect.rs`; UI `features/models/.../TemplatePanel.tsx` on
  the Eval tab. First of the **5.10+ diagnostics** band (metadata + local math).

- **5.11 KV-cache VRAM predictor + bandwidth (done).** Predicts VRAM as **base weights + KV
  cache(context)** so users stop guessing whether a model+context fits. The canonical f16 KV
  formula lives in `inference/vram_math.rs` (`2·layers·kv_heads·head_dim·2·ctx`, unit-tested:
  Llama-3-8B @ 8k = 1 GiB) and is exposed via `estimate_kv_cache_bytes`; the Quant tab's
  **context-length selector** (4K/8K/32K/128K, capped at the model max) drives it. Dims come from
  Ollama `/api/show` `model_info` (on `ModelInspect.dims`); non-Ollama falls back to the file-size
  ×1.3 heuristic, flagged **approximate**. A quant whose `base + KV` exceeds available memory gets an
  **"OOM Risk"** badge and is **blocked from running** (only when hardware is known); the
  recommendation respects the same gate. A note states local-LLM speed is **memory-bandwidth-bound**,
  showing the curated GB/s or "Not available". `vram_math.rs` + `hardware_mem.rs` (bandwidth) +
  `features/quant` (`useVramFit`, `QuantPage`, `fit.ts::fitOfNeed`).

- **5.12 Silent-CPU-fallback guard (done).** The Eval tab warns when the selected model is loaded
  with weights off the accelerator (the silent fallback that tanks speed and ruins eval timings):
  `cpuOffload(size, vram)` over `/api/ps` data, gated on an accelerator being present. Ollama-only;
  renders nothing when fully resident / not loaded / other backend. `features/eval/CpuFallbackBanner`.

- **5.13 Quant parse-rate delta (done).** The Quant table shows the quality lost to a smaller quant
  in percentage points vs the highest-quality scored quant (e.g. Q4_K_M "−17pp") + a "Δ vs Q8_0"
  note on the spread line. Pure `toolcallDelta`.

- **5.14 Context-budget readout + finance preset (done).** (a) A `ContextBudgetBar` in the Inspector
  shows the exact `prompt_eval_count / context_length`, red ≥95% (about to overflow and drop tokens);
  "Not available" when unknown. (b) A second **read-only built-in preset**, "Finance (preset)"
  (`tasks_finance.json`), via `list_builtin_collections` / `get_builtin_collection(id)`; the dataset
  picker lists Curated + Finance as read-only. Structural tool-call reliability — **not** PDF parsing.

- **5.15 Context-Cliff probe (done).** Runs the selected dataset at growing prompt lengths and graphs
  where tool-call accuracy collapses (`cliff.ts` + `useContextCliff` + a visx `ContextCliffChart` on
  the Eval tab). **Frontend-only**, padding is approximate (≈tokens via chars/4) and **labelled
  indicative** — no tokenizer; a failed rung records null, never a fabricated score.

### Phase 6 — Agentic reliability & the Automated-Pipeline workspace

Turns the single-turn checker into a stateful agentic diagnostic engine AND
reshapes the eval experience into a two-zone app. See [Agentic reliability
eval](reference.md#agentic-eval) for the contract.

**Navigation: two zones.** Zone 1 (Manual Playground): Workspace · **Compare**
(renamed from Analysis) · Inspector. Zone 2 (Automated Pipeline): **Eval** (the
3-pane workspace) · **Audit** (compliance home).

| # | Step | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6.1–6.4, 6.6 | Agentic engine: `DeterministicSandbox`, Tauri-free `run_once`/Pass^k runner, `FailureTracker`, effort metric, anti-cheat | done |
| 0 | Nav: Analysis → Compare, new Audit tab | done |
| 1 | Data contract: `ToolTask.agentic`, `EndStateRule` enum (`RequireSequence`/`ExpectAbstainingText`), `validate_tasks` gate | done |
| 2 | VRAM-safe sequential `run_batch` dispatcher + `run_batch_eval` streaming command | done |
| 3 | Throttled single-stream React consumer (rAF-buffered `batchStore`, `useBatchRun`) | done |
| 4 | 3-pane Eval workspace: `MatrixScoreboard` + `TraceDebugger` + audit export | done |
| 5 | Audit tab: saved Matrix history + export + Context-Cliff probe | done |
| 6 | Driver B lazy-agent traps: per-call `FaultInjection` (transient/persistent) in the sandbox + runner (`ToolError` step), authored in the Configurator | done |
| 7 | Driver D schema resilience: semantic `validate_call` + `max_recovery` loop (`SchemaError` step, `MalformedSchema` failure, `schema_resilience` metric) | done |
| 8 | Matrix `Schema Resil.` + `Cliff Depth` columns (cliff depth shared with the Inspector budget gauge via the `quantamind-cliff-<model>` marker) | done |
| 9 | CSV import: strict flat `id,prompt,expected_tool,expected_args` + shared Tools box → custom collection (`read_text_capped`, `csvImport.ts`, `CsvImportModal`); single-turn only, live located validation | done |

Locked decisions (set during planning): **iterate in Rust, never React** — one
`run_batch_eval` command runs a strict sequential model×task queue and streams
back over a single channel (no N-command JS loop → no local-inference OOM); the
runner is generic over a `ModelTurn` seam (testable with a scripted model, no
HTTP); `EndStateRule` is an enum so a correct abstention isn't scored as a lazy
failure; the React consumer buffers events and flushes at ≤60Hz so a token
firehose can't freeze the UI; the **Matrix is the central Eval artifact** (per-
model rows), not buried.

Follow-ups: persist each `run_batch_eval` to history (extend `RunSummary` with
agentic metrics) so the Audit timeline reflects batch runs; retire the now-
orphaned `run_collection_matrix`/`run_toolcall_eval` commands + `MatrixPanel`/
`ToolCallPanel` components once nothing references them.

### Phase 7 — Local Agent Readiness Validator

Packages the Phase-6 engine into a transparent **"is this model ready to replace
my cloud agent"** verdict. See [Local Agent Readiness](reference.md#agent-readiness)
for the contract.

| # | Step | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.1 | Pure `readiness::assess` verdict model (Ready/Conditional/NotReady) — epsilon-guarded thresholds, strict null-gating (required-but-unmeasured blocks), one scoring source of truth for GUI + future CLI | done |
| 7.1 | Editable built-in profiles (Coding agent / RAG assistant / General agent) as flat JSON via `persistence/readiness/profiles` + collision-proof `safe_filename` | done |
| — | `AggAgentic` carries the full `FailureTracker` so the loop/hallucination gates see exact counts, not just `top_error` | done |
| — | Persist the last `BatchReport` per collection (`persistence/readiness/reports`) — Rust is the verdict's source of truth, not the frontend store | done |
| 7.7 | **Agent Report** tab: pick a collection + profile, run `assess_readiness`, render per-model badges + interpolated reasons + measured path; shareable offline HTML export | done |
| 7.4 | **Hardware Telemetry**: measure VRAM fit (exact weights + real KV cache at the run's `num_ctx` vs an allocation cap) via the pure `readiness::vram_fit`; Host Hardware Profile panel (arch + cap dropdown) + per-model memory line; flips `require_full_vram` on for Coding-agent | done |
| 7.2 | **Native-FC test mode**: run the same agentic tasks through Ollama's native `/api/chat` `tool_calls` API (`NativeOllamaTurn` translates back to the canonical call shape, so the sandbox/scoring are byte-identical); parallel **Native FC pass^k** Matrix column behind a toggle; the verdict **prefers native** when measured. Ollama-only — llama.cpp/MLX N/A | done |
| 7.5 | **Resumable job queue + VRAM isolation**: append-only `.jsonl` job log per run (`persistence/jobs`), healed on a truncated tail; `run_batch_resumable` skips completed units (prompt AND native) and appends each new one; an injected `VramGate` (`OllamaVramGate` = `keep_alive:0` + `/api/ps` poll, **assert-and-fail**) evicts the previous model before the next loads; resume bulk-paints the Matrix from one partial report then streams the tail; transactional finish (save → verify → delete log) | done |
| 7.3 | **Agentic-aware recommender**: `assess_readiness` returns verdicts **ranked best-first** via the pure `readiness::recommend::rank` (tier Ready>Conditional>NotReady, ties by effort then steps, native-first metrics, float-safe `total_cmp`/`None→MAX`); the Agent Report opens with a leaderboard + a Recommendation banner ("Recommended for {profile}: {model} (Ready)", or "no model is ready — closest" — never a fabricated Ready) | done |
| 7.6 | Headless `quantamind-cli` | **dropped** |

**Phase 7 complete.** Deferred follow-ups: llama.cpp native-FC; the `unmeasured`/🔧
badge (lands with a real probe to trigger); per-run (k-level) job granularity.

Locked decisions: **never fabricate** — an unmeasured hard-required metric blocks
(ignorance is not a pass), unknowns render N/A, prompt-based vs native paths are
labelled never conflated; thresholds live in **editable profiles**, not constants;
built-in profiles gate only on metrics measured today (Pass^k, loop/hallucination
taxonomy, steps, and — since 7.4 — VRAM fit on Coding-agent), so a default profile
doesn't mark every model NotReady for infra reasons. The **context-cliff is now
wired** end-to-end (Matrix pre-fills the probe → measured cliff saved per
(collection, model) → fed into the verdict → shown in the Agent Report), but the
`min_context_tokens` gate stays **opt-in** (off in the built-ins; a custom profile
turns it on) so an un-probed model is never silently failed. VRAM fit is **Ollama-precise**
(real `/api/show` dims) — single-model backends are N/A, never approximated; the
cap is auto-detected and overridable in-session (not persisted). The verdict scoring
is **one function** (`assess`) so GUI and the future CLI can never diverge.

### Phase 8 — Publish & Community (OSS client, PART B)

Turns a local readiness verdict into a shareable asset and (opt-in) aggregate data
for the recommender. Phase 8 spans two systems: a **closed backend** (separate
private, hosted repo — token authority, publish API, validation, dedup, leaderboard,
baselines, moderation; out of scope for this open repo) and the **OSS client** flow
here. The app stays 100% functional offline — a publish/auth failure never touches it.

| # | Step | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8.B4 | **Offline share export** — fully offline, no auth, no backend. Pure `buildReadinessMarkdown` (GFM table + per-model reasons, "N/A" never fabricated); `snapshotPng` rasterizes the report card via `html-to-image` (embedded fonts + warm-up render; hardcoded white background); a thin `save_readiness_image` Rust sink writes the PNG bytes (path via OS dialog). The Agent Report's **Export Report** menu offers Image / Copy Markdown / HTML | done |
| 8.B2 | Canonical record (`persistence/publish/`, pure: metrics-only `PublishRow`, sorted-key deterministic JSON + SHA-256 hash + local `pre_validate`) + `commands/publish/cohort.rs` (v1 hardware cohort key) + `preview_publish_payload` + privacy gate (`PublishDialog`: shows the exact raw payload, default opt-out) | done |
| 8.B1 | PKCE auth + hybrid vault (`commands/publish/{auth,pkce,token,login_cmd}.rs`, `keyring` with in-memory fallback when no secret service; S256 challenge; loopback redirect; rotating refresh + cached access token) — `enterprise`-gated, verified against `mockito` | done |
| 8.B3 | Send pipeline (`publish_cmd.rs`: fresh nonce → canonical hash → batch POST; typed `PublishOutcome` for 200/401/422-with-index/426/429, **fresh nonce per attempt**) + walled-garden write-up link + UI wiring (`PublishButton`, never freezes) — `enterprise`-gated, verified against `mockito` | done |

Locked decisions: **server-side everything** (the open client is untrusted; the
backend enforces rate limits, validation, dedup, anti-replay); **no client secret**
(PKCE); **privacy gate** sends metrics + cohort tags + signature only, never task
content/prompts/file names, default opt-out, disabled in enterprise builds; results
are labelled **"community-reported"** (self-fabrication is deterred via validation +
outliers + GitHub identity + report/remove, never cryptographically prevented). The
**export (B4) is ungated** — it ships in every build, including enterprise.

### Phase 8+

Owners flesh out the next phase's section here when the current lands.

---

## Future considerations

Parking lot for ideas, libraries, and changes deliberately deferred. Nothing
here is in the current phase — see [Phase roadmap](#phase-roadmap). If something
here becomes relevant, move it into a phase plan first.

### Full end-state agentic context-cliff

The context-cliff probe now *includes* agentic collections, but scores them on JSON **well-formedness**
only — does the model still emit a parseable tool call as context grows (see `reference.md#context-cliff`).
That catches a real failure mode (the tool-call FORMAT degrading with context) but **not** task
correctness. A fuller probe — "at what context length does **multi-step** agentic accuracy collapse?" —
would run the sandbox conversation under padding, decide where the needle lands among turns, and
aggregate **Pass^k per rung** against `agentic.end_state`. **Activate when:** a phase wants correctness
(not just format) context-headroom signal for agentic workloads. **Why deferred:** it's a new multi-turn
engine (padding placement across turns, per-rung Pass^k), not a tweak to the single-turn probe.

### Additional STT engines (faster-whisper)

**Removed:** `mlx-audio` was trialed as a second STT engine but removed — its
0.4.4 server crashes during transcription (its inference broker runs the model on
a worker thread with no Metal GPU stream), and the transcription endpoint only
exists in that broken release. The MLX whisper model itself works *inline*, so a
future engine could wrap `mlx-whisper` directly (bypassing mlx-audio's server),
but that's a custom sidecar with its own maintenance cost — not worth it while
whisper.cpp covers Apple Silicon well. (The MLX **LLM** backend is unaffected.)

**Why deferred:** `faster-whisper` (the path for Ollama users, who have no native
STT) gets its own `commands/stt/<engine>` lifecycle. **Activate when:** a later
phase needs Ollama-user parity. It exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it
must keep the loopback-only `stt_probe` guardrail (never silently reach
`api.openai.com`).

### Apple Developer ID + notarization (macOS)

**Why deferred:** $99/yr Apple Developer Program + ~24-48h approval. Current
ad-hoc signing (`signingIdentity: "-"`) eliminates the "damaged" error; testers
right-click → Open past the "unverified developer" warning. Acceptable for
v0.1.x tester distribution. **Activate when:** moving to a public one-click
download, or a tester refuses to right-click → Open.

Enrollment checklist: enroll at developer.apple.com/programs; in Xcode →
Settings → Accounts add the Apple ID, then Manage Certificates → "+" →
**Developer ID Application**; note the **Team ID**; generate an **app-specific
password** (label "notarytool"); export the env vars before `scripts/release.sh`:

```sh
export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_ID="you@example.com"
export APPLE_PASSWORD="abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop"   # the app-specific password
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID1234"
```

`scripts/notarize.sh` detects the env vars, re-signs the `.app`/`.dmg` with
hardened runtime, submits to Apple, waits, and staples the ticket. Verify with
`xcrun stapler validate dist/*.dmg` and `spctl --assess --verbose=4`. Known
notarytool rejections: missing secure timestamp (add `--timestamp`), JIT not
entitled (add `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit` to `macos.entitlements`),
hardened runtime not enabled (confirm `--options runtime`).

### Windows code-signing certificate

**Why deferred:** an OV/EV cert is $200-400/yr plus identity verification; EV
certs ship on a hardware token (or cloud HSM) that CI must reach. v0.2 ships the
`.msi`/`.exe` **unsigned**, so SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC"
once — users click **More info → Run anyway**. **Activate when:** Windows becomes
a primary target or a tester refuses the warning. Checklist: buy OV (instant-ish)
or EV (clears reputation faster); for OV export the `.pfx`, store base64 as
`WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE` and password as `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`; set
`bundle.windows.certificateThumbprint` in `tauri.conf.json`; EV needs a cloud-HSM
signing service. Verify with `signtool verify /pa`.

### Intel Mac build target

Current builds are `aarch64-apple-darwin` only; Intel users get a "platform not
found" from the updater. Add `x86_64-apple-darwin` + a universal-binary `lipo`
step when an actual Intel tester appears.
