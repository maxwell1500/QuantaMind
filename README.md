## Overview

**QuantaMind** is a native desktop application that turns your computer into a serious workbench for local language models. What began as three tools (Workspace, Model Management, Compare) now spans the whole local-agent workflow — from a single prompt to a hardware-aware, go/no-go readiness verdict:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Workspace** | Write a prompt, pick a model, stream the answer back with timing metrics, save/load the prompt as YAML. |
| **Voice (Speech-to-Text)** | Record or upload audio, transcribe it locally with **whisper.cpp**, and pipe the transcript straight into the selected LLM — a full voice → assistant loop, all offline. |
| **Analysis** (Compare) | Run the same prompt through multiple models side-by-side, with a hardware feasibility check up front and Markdown/JSON export. |
| **Inspector** | Per-token timing forensics for a run — TTFT phase breakdown, a per-token latency timeline, and an inter-token latency histogram. |
| **Model Management** | Install, inspect, and uninstall models from three sources — Ollama library, Hugging Face GGUF, local files — without touching a terminal. |
| **Eval** | Score models on single-turn tool-calling and multi-step agentic tasks (Pass^k, schema resilience, context-cliff), with custom collections + CSV import. |
| **Quant** | Compare quantizations of one model family — size vs quality vs whether it fits in memory. |
| **Agent Report** | Turn the measurements into a per-model **Ready / Conditional / Not Ready** verdict against a chosen readiness profile and your hardware. |

Under the hood: a ~30 MB Tauri binary — a native shell wrapped around a Rust backend and a React/TypeScript frontend, talking to local model servers over HTTP: **Ollama**, **llama.cpp** (`llama-server`), and **MLX** (`mlx_lm`, Apple Silicon) behind a single `InferenceBackend` trait. Speech-to-text runs on its own parallel axis — a **whisper.cpp** (`whisper-server`) sidecar on `:8093` — so one STT engine runs alongside one LLM without ever touching the text-inference path.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everything runs on your machine. There is no QuantaMind cloud, no account, no telemetry. Your prompts and your model outputs never leave your hardware.

---

## Why QuantaMind

Anyone who has spent a weekend with local models knows the friction:

- You install Ollama, then realize you have to memorize CLI flags.
- You find a great GGUF on Hugging Face — but Ollama needs a Modelfile with the *right* chat template, and getting that wrong silently poisons every generation.
- You want to compare three models on the same prompt; now you're copy-pasting into three terminals and timing them with a stopwatch.
- You burn a 20 GB download halfway through and never notice the partial file lingering.

QuantaMind exists to remove that friction without hiding the underlying tools. It doesn't replace Ollama; it sits on top of it as a **well-engineered workspace** that makes the same primitives usable.

Three design commitments shape every decision:

1. **Local-first, always.** Your prompts, your models, your hardware, your data.
2. **Honest UX.** When the system can't guarantee something, the UI says so plainly instead of fabricating confidence.
3. **Engineering discipline.** Small files, separated concerns, strict data-quality gates after every change.

---

## Features

### Workspace
- Monaco-based prompt editor (same editor that powers VS Code)
- Live model picker driven by `/api/tags` — what shows is what Ollama can actually serve right now
- Token-by-token streaming output in a preserved-whitespace pane
- Explicit `running` / `streaming` / `done` / `cancelled` / `error` terminal states
- Clean cancellation that cuts the HTTP stream — no fake "done" events
- Save and load prompts as YAML with byte-identical round-trip
- Per-run metrics: TTFT in ms, sustained tokens/sec, token count
- Persistent status bar: model name, Ollama health pill, latest run metrics

### Speech-to-Text (Voice)
- Local transcription via **whisper.cpp** (`whisper-server`) — its own engine axis, parallel to the LLM backend, on a fixed port `:8093`
- One-time setup walked through in **Models → Speech-to-Text**: `brew install whisper-cpp`, then download a model — QuantaMind finds the engine automatically on `PATH`/Homebrew (no path setup), with a `--help` dry-run so "found" never masquerades as "runnable"
- Curated model catalog: tiny / base / small / medium (English + multilingual), large-v3 and large-v3-turbo, plus quantized variants — real Hugging Face download sizes shown up front
- Each download is atomic — the whisper ggml **and** the shared silero VAD are promoted both-or-none; half-installs are swept at startup
- Start the engine from the header **Speech-to-Text** control (`▶` + model picker + health dot); the Workspace switches to a two-pane transcribe view while it runs
- **Record** from the mic or **upload** a WAV; audio is decoded → downmixed → resampled to 16 kHz mono **in Rust**, then sent to whisper-server one ~30 s window at a time
- **Voice → assistant**: the transcript becomes the user message, an optional typed prompt sets the system/context, and the selected LLM streams a reply — flip on **Auto-summarize** to fire the LLM automatically when a recording finishes (a production-faithful end-to-end timing)
- Offline-only by construction: a loopback-only probe means transcription never silently reaches the cloud — a down local server fails loud instead

### Model Management
- One modal, three tabs: Ollama Library, Hugging Face, Local File
- Disk-space pre-check refuses any install that would leave < 2 GB free
- Real-time progress: bytes / total / speed (5-second moving average) / ETA
- Cancel button on every in-flight install
- Storage tab with size-sorted list, family, parameter count, quantization
- One-click Uninstall guarded by an `alertdialog` confirmation
- Storage path section that shows current `OLLAMA_MODELS` and *honestly* helps you change it

### Compare (Analysis tab)
- Top-level tab parallel to Workspace
- Multi-select installed models, one prompt, three strategies
- Hardware feasibility verdict: `ok` / `risky` / `wont_fit` — computed at click time
- Per-model streaming column with its own metrics row
- Throughput + TTFT comparison chart; word-level output diff
- Export full run as Markdown or JSON via save dialog

### Backends
- One `InferenceBackend` trait, three runtimes: **Ollama**, **llama.cpp** (`llama-server`), **MLX** (`mlx_lm`, Apple Silicon only)
- The backend is bound to the model's weight format — auto-picked, never a silent fallback
- Each external server is launched stream-aware (no blind timeout), reaped on app exit, and bound to a dynamically chosen free port

### Inspector
- Per-token timing forensics for the last run
- TTFT breakdown: model-load vs prompt-prefill vs generation, as a stacked phase bar
- Per-token latency timeline (visx) with outlier highlighting and phase boundaries
- Inter-token latency histogram, VRAM bar, context-budget bar
- Cold- vs warm-start comparison, memory-leak heuristic, regression alerts, HTML report export

### Eval
- Score models on **single-turn tool-calling** and **multi-step agentic** tasks
- Deterministic, sandbox-free scoring: composite tool-call accuracy (parse · tool · args · abstain), **Pass^k** reliability, avg steps, effort, **schema resilience**, dominant failure mode
- **Context-cliff** probe — backend engine that pads tasks with license-clean synthetic presets, sweeps the instruction across mid-document depths, and verifies each rung to ±5% of the target, finding the prompt length where tool-call accuracy collapses (real measured prompt tokens, never an estimate); a failing rung keeps the model's verbatim completion so a red "0% / Broken" shows *what* the model emitted, not just that it failed
- Author custom collections by hand or bulk-load single-turn tasks via CSV import
- Optional native function-calling path (Ollama `/api/chat` `tools`) alongside the prompt-based proxy

### Quant
- Compare a model family's installed quantizations side by side
- Size · hardware fit (OOM risk) · quality (eval pass-rate) · tool-call composite
- Recommends the best size↔quality↔fit trade-off for your use case and context length

### Agent Report
- Per-model **Ready / Conditional / Not Ready** verdict with the exact blocking + conditional reasons
- Hardware-aware: VRAM fit (exact weights + KV cache vs an allocation cap, with a pressure flag)
- Configurable readiness profiles (min Pass^k, forbid loops/false-done, require full VRAM, min context, require native FC)
- Export the verdict table as a standalone HTML report

## Tech stack

> [!NOTE]
> These choices are **locked**. Substitutions require explicit review.

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop shell | **Tauri 2.x** | ~30 MB binaries, native WebView, Rust backend |
| Backend language | **Rust 1.75+** (ed. 2021) | Tauri default; safe IPC + HTTP |
| Frontend framework | **React 18 + TypeScript 5** | Largest open-source contributor pool |
| Build tool | **Vite 5** | Fast HMR, Tauri-friendly |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS 3** | Utility-first, no design-system overhead |
| State management | **Zustand** | ~1 KB, no boilerplate, scales |
| Editor | **`@monaco-editor/react`** | Same editor as VS Code |
| HTTP client (Rust) | **`reqwest` + `tokio`** | Battle-tested |
| Speech-to-text engine | **whisper.cpp** (`whisper-server` sidecar) | Local STT over HTTP on `:8093`, mirroring the `llama-server` lifecycle; subprocess, not FFI |
| Audio preprocessing (Rust) | **`hound` + `rubato`** | Decode WAV → downmix → resample to 16 kHz mono in-process, explicit and logged |
| Voice-activity detection | **`webrtc-vad`** | Independent, non-ML VAD for the silence-hallucination metric (never the STT model's own opinion) |
| Serialization | **`serde` + `serde_json` / `serde_yaml`** | Type-safe across IPC |
| Validation (TS) | **`zod`** | Runtime schema validation at IPC boundary |
| Validation (Rust) | **`validator` + `serde`** | Type-level + custom validators |
| Testing (Rust) | **`cargo test` + `mockito`** | Built-in, no setup |
| Testing (TS) | **`vitest` + `@testing-library/react`** | Fast, Vite-native |
| Format / Lint | **`rustfmt` + Prettier / Clippy + ESLint** | Auto-format on save |
| Pre-commit | **`lefthook`** | Lighter than Husky |
| CI | **GitHub Actions** | Free for open source |

<details>
<summary><b>What is deliberately NOT installed (yet)</b></summary>

- No logging library — `println!` / `console.log`; structured persistence is deliberately deferred
- No state-machine library — Zustand is enough
- No UI component library — Tailwind utilities only
- No form library — there are no real forms yet
- No in-process AI/ML libraries — QuantaMind *calls* Ollama; it doesn't run inference itself

Every dependency is a maintenance debt. Resist additions.

**Module boundaries**

| Side | Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `app/` | App shell, routing, providers. No feature logic. |
| Frontend | `features/<name>/` | Vertical slice: components, hooks, state, types, tests. Deletable in one `rm -rf`. |
| Frontend | `shared/ipc/` | **Only** place that calls Tauri `invoke`. Typed wrappers + zod schemas. |
| Frontend | `shared/components/` | Primitives reused by 2+ features. |
| Backend | `commands/` | IPC entry points. Thin: validate, call domain, return. |
| Backend | `inference/` | Backend adapters behind the `InferenceBackend` trait — Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX — plus the eval/readiness scoring engines. |
| Backend | `metrics/` | TTFT, tokens/sec, per-token timeline, VRAM. |
| Backend | `persistence/` | YAML/JSON read+write for prompts and history. |
| Backend | `validation/` | Schemas shared by commands and persistence. |
| Backend | `errors.rs` | Single `AppError` enum. **No `unwrap()` outside tests.** |

The two halves talk JSON over Tauri's IPC. Contracts are explicit in `shared/ipc/types.ts` on the TS side, mirrored in Rust — no codegen.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust** | 1.75+ | |
| **Node** | 20+ | |
| **pnpm** | 9+ | |
| **Ollama** | latest | Primary backend |
| **llama.cpp** (`llama-server`) | optional | Run GGUF models directly |
| **MLX** (`pip install mlx-lm`) | optional | Apple Silicon only |
| **whisper.cpp** (`brew install whisper-cpp`) | optional | Speech-to-text; set up in-app under Models → Speech-to-Text |

### Install

```bash
# 1) Toolchains (macOS only for now)
brew install rust node pnpm ollama
xcode-select --install

# 2) Start Ollama + pull a small model
ollama serve &
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags   # smoke-test that Ollama is up

# 3) Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/QuantaMinds/QuantaMind.git quantamind
cd quantamind/frontend
pnpm install

# 4) Run in dev mode
pnpm tauri dev
```

The first run opens a native window. Editing `frontend/src/App.tsx` and saving triggers HMR.

### First prompt
1. Pick a model from the dropdown.
2. Type a prompt (`Why is the sky blue?` is a good smoke test).
3. Click **Run**.
4. Watch tokens stream in. Note the metrics line below the output.

### First install from the UI
1. Click the **+** next to the Model Picker to open the **Add Model** modal.
2. Pick a tab:
   - **Ollama Library** — type any model name (e.g. `mistral:7b`) and click Install.
   - **Hugging Face** — search a GGUF repo, click a result, pick a variant.
   - **Local File** — drag a `.gguf` onto the modal or click Browse.
3. Confirm any disk-space warnings, click Install, watch the progress bar.

### First transcription (voice)
1. Open **Models → Speech-to-Text**. If whisper.cpp isn't found, run `brew install whisper-cpp` (the tab has a copy button) and click **Re-check**.
2. Download a model from the catalog — **Base (English)** is a good first pick (~148 MB). The shared silero VAD comes with it automatically.
3. In the header **Speech-to-Text** control, pick the model and press **▶** to start the engine. The Workspace switches to the two-pane transcribe view.
4. Press **Record** (or upload a WAV), speak, then stop. The transcript streams into the left pane.
5. Optionally type an assistant prompt, pick an LLM in the header, and click **Ask the assistant** — or flip on **Auto-summarize** to have it run automatically.

## Deep dive — Workspace

### The flow
1. Open QuantaMind. The Model Picker fetches `/api/tags` from your local Ollama.
2. Type or paste a prompt into the Monaco editor.
3. Click **Run**.
4. Tokens stream into the output pane in real time.
5. The run terminates with one of:
   - **Done** — full metrics shown (TTFT, tok/s, token count)
   - **Cancelled** — distinct amber state, token count only
   - **Error** — typed error surfaced as a banner
6. Optionally save the prompt to a YAML file for reuse.

### State separation rule
A codified rule across the codebase:

> **Hooks own ephemeral per-action state; the store owns shared cross-component state.** Hooks may write to the store at completion. Components must not read both for the same data — pick one source.

In practice: the currently-streaming output and run status live in `useStreamingRun`'s local `useState`. The most-recent run's final metrics are written into the Zustand `useWorkspaceStore` so the StatusBar (a separate part of the tree) can render them without prop-drilling.

### YAML round-trip
`StoredPrompt { model, prompt }` serializes with `serde_yaml` to a two-field document. Loading produces the same struct; saving it back produces a **byte-identical** file. The round-trip is asserted in the test suite for ASCII, multi-line (block scalar form `|-`), and UTF-8-with-embedded-quotes payloads.

### Cancellation
A `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` threads through the entire HTTP stream:
- An outer `tokio::select!` races the token against the next byte chunk
- An inner per-token check breaks the line-parse loop early
- The backend emits a dedicated `prompt-cancelled` event (**not** `prompt-done`) so the UI can render a distinct terminal state

### Timeouts
Every cross-process call has a budget:

| Call | Timeout |
|---|---|
| `run_prompt` | 30 s outer + 60 s reqwest connect; no per-request timeout on the stream |
| `stop_prompt` | 5 s |
| `list_models` | 5 s |

Timeouts surface as `AppError::Timeout` with a human-readable label.

## Deep dive — Speech-to-Text

Speech-to-text is an **additive, parallel capability**. It never touches the `InferenceBackend` trait or `run_prompt` — the STT engine is its own state axis, so one whisper.cpp engine runs alongside one LLM.

### Setting up the engine
The **Models → Speech-to-Text** tab drives a three-state flow off a single engine check:

| Engine state | What you see |
|---|---|
| Not installed | A setup card: install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run `brew install whisper-cpp`, click **Re-check** |
| Installed but not runnable | A reinstall card (`brew reinstall whisper-cpp`) — the binary is present but its dylibs are missing/mismatched |
| Ready | The model catalog + server controls |

The binary is discovered **most-explicit-first**: `UserSettings.stt_engine_dir` → `QUANTAMIND_WHISPER_DIR` → `PATH`/Homebrew → bundled resources → dev tree. So a plain `brew install whisper-cpp` is found with no path setup; installed it elsewhere? **Choose its folder** (remembered across launches). QuantaMind only reports ready after a `--help` dry-run proves the engine actually executes — "found" never masquerades as "runnable".

### Models
All whisper ggml models come from `ggerganov/whisper.cpp`; the shared silero VAD (`ggml-silero-v6.2.0.bin`) comes from `ggml-org/whisper-vad`. The curated catalog (real HF sizes shown before download):

| Model | Size | Languages |
|---|---|---|
| Tiny / Base / Small / Medium (`.en`) | 78 MB – 1.5 GB | English |
| Tiny / Base / Small / Medium | 78 MB – 1.5 GB | Multilingual |
| Large v3 / Large v3 Turbo | 3.1 GB / 1.6 GB | Multilingual |
| Quantized variants (`q5_0` / `q5_1`) | 32 MB – 1.1 GB | much smaller, near-identical accuracy |

`download_stt_model` stages the whisper ggml **and** the VAD, validates both, and promotes **both-or-none**; `reconcile_stt_dir` sweeps half-installs at startup. Runtime VRAM isn't measured yet, so the UI shows **"Not available"** rather than a fabricated figure.

### The transcription seam
```
record / upload WAV
  ↓  hound (decode) → downmix → rubato (resample → 16 kHz mono), in Rust, logged
whisper-server /inference   (one call per ~30 s window, verbose_json)
  ↓  stream segments through TranscribeSink
canonical Transcript        (persisted atomically; an incomplete run is refused)
```
Every `TranscribeStats` field is `Option` — no fabricated metric.

### Voice → assistant
The transcript becomes the **user message**; an optional typed prompt is the **system/context** (e.g. *"You are a customer support agent"*). Both go to the selected LLM, which streams its reply through the same rich metrics path as a normal Workspace run. With **Auto-summarize** on, the LLM fires automatically the moment a transcription completes (the STT→LLM auto-pipe), so the end-to-end time is production-faithful.

### Server lifecycle & failure states
The sidecar runs on a fixed `:8093` (clear of MLX's `8082..=8092` scan range) with **`/health`-gated readiness** — HTTP 200 once the model is loaded, 503 while loading — graceful-then-hard kill, and reaping on app exit alongside the LLM sidecars. Start failures (`start_whisper_server`) return a tagged result so the UI says exactly what to fix:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `not_bundled` | No `whisper-server` found — install whisper.cpp |
| `model_missing` | The whisper model file isn't on disk — download one first |
| `vad_missing` | The silero VAD is absent — re-run the download |
| `port_conflict` | Something else holds `:8093`; QuantaMind won't take over a process it didn't start |

A server that won't answer on `127.0.0.1` fails **loud** — STT is offline-only and never falls back to the cloud.

## Deep dive — Model Management

The largest piece of code in the app, because installing models cleanly is *hard*.

### Three sources

<details open>
<summary><b>Ollama Library</b> — free-text input + Install</summary>

Type any model name Ollama knows (`mistral:7b`, `qwen2.5:14b`, …) and the backend's `pull_model` command POSTs `/api/pull` with `stream: true`, parses NDJSON line-buffered, and emits per-chunk progress events.

A live `list_models` subscription marks the typed name **Installed ✓** the moment it appears.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hugging Face</b> — search the live HF API</summary>

```
GET https://huggingface.co/api/models
  ?search=<q>&library=gguf&sort=downloads&direction=-1&limit=30
```

Clicking a result opens a detail view that lists every `.gguf` file in the repo via `GET /api/models/{repo}/tree/main?recursive=true`. The quantization label is parsed from the filename (`Q4_K_M`, `IQ4_XS`, `BF16`, …); the install name is derived as `<basename>:<quant>` to satisfy Ollama's name validator.

Downloads stream to a `.partial` file with HTTP `Range` header support — interrupted installs **resume** on the next click.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Local file</b> — drag-and-drop or Browse</summary>

QuantaMind reads the first 64 KB of the `.gguf` file with a pure-Rust GGUF v3 header parser to extract:

- architecture (`llama`, `qwen2`, `phi3`, …)
- parameter count
- context length
- quantization (from `general.file_type`, with filename fallback)
- family (derived from architecture)

The parser handles the full GGUF value-type set (`UINT8`…`FLOAT64`, including `UINT16`/`INT16`/`FLOAT64`), so models that store scalar metadata in narrow integer types — e.g. some Qwen 2.5 Coder exports — parse instead of failing on an unsupported value tag.

The user reviews metadata, picks a name (validated by regex + against existing models), clicks Import.

</details>

### What "Import" does

For both HF and Local sources, the keystone pipeline:

```
inspect_gguf(path)              → GgufMetadata
  ↓
detect_template(name, arch)     → Option<ChatTemplate>
  ↓
generate_modelfile(spec)        → Modelfile string
  ↓
ollama_create(name, modelfile)  → POST /api/create (NDJSON stream)
  ↓
verify_model_registered(name)   → backoff poll of /api/tags
  ↓
emit("models-changed")          → refresh installed list everywhere
```

The **chat template registry** covers 8 families today: Llama 3, Qwen/ChatML, Mistral, Phi-3, Gemma, Command-R, DeepSeek, Yi. Architecture is checked first (more reliable than name); name substring is a fallback. Unknown families return `None` so the UI surfaces a warning rather than emitting a wrong-template Modelfile.

### Disk pre-check

Before any install path downloads:

```
free = current free disk space at $OLLAMA_MODELS
need = estimated_size_bytes × 1.05   # 5 % safety margin

if free < 2 GB  after install → BlockedInsufficientSpace
if free < 10 GB after install → Warning
else                          → Ok
```

Constants are justified in code: 2 GB covers OS swap and app caches; 10 GB covers a week of the user's other work.

### Storage view

Sorted by size descending. Each row: family · parameter size · quantization · size. Uninstall opens an `alertdialog` that names the model and the bytes it frees. Only the Remove button (red) calls `DELETE /api/delete`. On success the backend emits `models-changed` and every consumer in the app re-fetches once.

---

## Deep dive — Compare

### Strategy choice

All three strategies are always visible so users can compare verdicts before picking. The Run button re-validates at click time and refuses to run a `wont_fit` strategy.

| Strategy | Memory needed | Wall-clock today | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sequential** | `max(model_size)` | `N × per-model latency` | Safest default |
| **Parallel** | `sum(model_size)` | ≈ sequential (Ollama serializes) | Honest about issue time; ready for a second backend |
| **Sequential w/ skip** | `max(model_size)` | ≤ sequential | Bail out when you've seen enough |

### Feasibility math

```
required(model)        = ceil(size_bytes × 1.3)   # runtime > on-disk
sequential / skippable = max(required)
parallel               = sum(required)

verdict = need > avail        ? "wont_fit"
        : need > avail × 0.7  ? "risky"
                              : "ok"
```

`avail` comes from `sysinfo::System` available memory. On Apple Silicon it's labelled "Unified memory"; no discrete-VRAM probe yet.

### Event bus

Backend emits five `compare-*` events, each payload carries a per-row `model_id` (UUID generated at invoke time):

| Event | Payload |
|---|---|
| `compare-token` | `{ model_id, model, text }` per chunk |
| `compare-done` | `{ model_id, model, ttft_ms, tokens_per_sec, token_count }` |
| `compare-cancelled` | `{ model_id, model, token_count }` |
| `compare-error` | `{ model_id, model, kind, message }` |
| `compare-run-done` | Terminator; flips pending rows to `cancelled` |

### Export

`buildReport(...)` snapshots the store at click time. `toMarkdown(report)` and `toJson(report)` are pure functions of that value — streaming after Export doesn't mutate what was saved. The user picks a destination via `plugin-dialog::save`; the backend writes the file.

---

## Install pipeline internals

The install path has a shared invariant:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A successful install must be observable in the UI before the install hook returns "success".**

Getting there required hardening against several known Ollama 0.24+ behaviors.

### The `/api/tags` lag race
Ollama streams `{"status":"success"}` from `/api/create` *before* the new model is reflected in `/api/tags`. Observed lag: **50–800 ms**. A naive one-shot check races and reports a false "silently rolled back" error.

`verify_model_registered` solves this with a backoff ladder (50 / 100 / 200 / 400 / 800 / 1500 ms) plus a final confirmation read. Only after **all seven checks miss** does it declare a rollback.

### The un-terminated final-line problem
Ollama 0.24+ has been observed to close the HTTP connection with the final `{"status":"success"}` un-flushed and *un-terminated by a newline*. A line-based NDJSON parser drops that chunk and concludes the stream failed.

`backend/src/inference/ndjson.rs` flushes the un-terminated remainder via `ndjson::tail(&buf)` after stream close and re-runs the same chunk parser. Five integration tests cover the with-newline and without-newline success paths.

### Terminal states stay visible
The "In progress" list previously filtered to `["downloading", "installing"]` only, so entries vanished the instant status flipped to `success` or `error`. The list now retains terminal entries with badges and a Dismiss button. Success entries auto-clear after 5 s; error entries persist until dismissed.

### Self-healing refresh
`installedModelsStore` is the single source of truth for the installed list. A `models-changed` event bus mirrors `downloadEventBus`: one shared `listen("models-changed")` subscription mounted once in `App.tsx`, dispatching into the store. All five consumers subscribe to the store and fall back to calling `refresh()` themselves when status is `idle` — a self-heal that survives Tauri listener-registration races.

`remove_model` emits the same `models-changed` event, symmetric with install paths.

## Live model browsing

QuantaMind originally shipped bundled JSON catalogs of "popular" models. Those went stale fast. The current build replaces them with **live API queries**.

| Surface | Source | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Hugging Face search | `GET /api/models?library=gguf&...` | Inline error + Retry button |
| HF repo detail | `GET /api/models/{repo}/tree/main?recursive=true` | Inline error + Retry button |
| Ollama Library | Free-text input + live `list_models` subscription | Ollama's own error (404 → "not found") |

All backend HTTP clients set `User-Agent: quantamind/<version>`. HF behind Cloudflare can 400 on an empty UA; this prevents that.

## Engineering principles

> [!WARNING]
> These rules are non-negotiable. They're enforced in `CLAUDE.md` and applied to every change before it lands.

1. **One step at a time.** Don't start step N+1 until step N is implemented, its test passes, *and* its output is verified.
2. **Test pass ≠ data quality pass.** A green test proves the code ran the path you asked it to. The *output* must also match expected shape and values.
3. **Single-concern files.** Split a file when it starts doing two things — by responsibility, not by line count. (Folder taxonomy: ≤ 10 files per folder.)
4. **Separation of concerns.** Each file does one thing. No `utils.ts`, `helpers/`, `common/`, or `misc/`.
5. **Documentation ships with the change.** Same commit.
6. **Locked tech stack.** Substitutions require explicit review.

### The data-quality gate

After every green test, run through this checklist:

| Check | Looking for |
|---|---|
| **Shape** | Correct types, required fields present, no surprise fields; for streams: chunk count, ordering, terminator |
| **Values** | Within reasonable ranges; correct units (ms vs s, bytes vs MB); correct encoding (UTF-8, no BOM) |
| **Edge cases** | Empty input → empty output (not crash); large input handled or rejected; Unicode/emoji/RTL preserved; malformed input → typed error, not panic |
| **Cross-boundary fidelity** | Rust → JSON → TS field round-trip (snake_case vs camelCase!); disk → memory YAML byte-identical |
| **Determinism** | Same input → same output where applicable |

If verification fails, **fix the code, not the assertion**.

---

## Development workflow

The mandatory loop:

```
[1] Understand the step
[2] Implement the minimum
[3] Write the test
[4] Run the test
[5] Verify the output (data-quality gate)
[6] Update docs
[7] Commit (Conventional Commits)
[8] Move on
```

### Common violations (don't do)
- **Stacking steps** — "Let me knock out 1–3 then test." No.
- **Loosening assertions** — If `assert eq 42` fails because output is 41, fix the code.
- **Skipping verification because the test passed** — tests verify the path you wrote; verification confirms the path was right.
- **Bundling docs into "I'll update them later"** — later does not exist.
- **Refactoring during a feature** — open a separate branch.

### Naming conventions

| Domain | Style | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Rust functions / vars | `snake_case` | `run_prompt` |
| Rust types | `PascalCase` | `InferenceBackend` |
| Rust constants | `SCREAMING_SNAKE` | `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| TS functions / vars | `camelCase` | `runPrompt` |
| TS components / types | `PascalCase` | `PromptEditor` |
| React component file | `PascalCase.tsx` | `PromptEditor.tsx` |
| TS non-component file | `kebab-case.ts` | `use-streaming-run.ts` |
| Rust file | `snake_case.rs` | `ollama.rs` |
| Git branch | `phase-N/feature-name` | `phase-1/streaming-output` |

### Commits — Conventional Commits

| Prefix | Use for |
|---|---|
| `feat:` | New user-visible behavior |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `chore:` | Tooling, deps, config |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `test:` | Adding or fixing tests |
| `refactor:` | No behavior change |

One step = one commit (or a tight related series). PR title matches the convention. PR body references `closes #N` when applicable.

### Errors
- **Rust:** `Result<T, AppError>` only. **No `unwrap()` outside tests.** Enforced by Clippy `deny(unwrap_used)` in critical files.
- **TypeScript:** discriminated unions returned across IPC. No thrown errors over the IPC boundary.

---

## Testing

### Frontend (vitest + Testing Library)
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm test            # run once
pnpm test --watch    # watch mode
```

Tests live next to code in `__tests__/` directories. Naming: tests are named after the behavior, not the function — `streams_tokens_in_order` not `test_run_prompt`. One behavior per test.

### Backend (cargo + mockito)
```bash
cd backend
cargo test           # unit + integration
cargo clippy --tests # lint
cargo fmt --check    # format
```

Inline `#[cfg(test)]` for unit tests; `backend/tests/` for integration (cargo convention). Mockito serves fixture responses for HTTP-dependent code paths.

### What we test
- **Stream ordering** — tokens arrive in correct order, byte-exact concat matches fixture
- **Cancellation** — no orphan tokens after cancel; HTTP connection closes
- **YAML round-trip** — save → load → save produces byte-identical files
- **IPC validation** — malformed payloads rejected with typed errors, no `NaN`/`undefined` reaching UI
- **Mutex poison recovery** — panic mid-lock doesn't crash; metrics degrade gracefully
- **Timeout enforcement** — `run_prompt` rejects with `AppError::Timeout` after 30 s
- **GGUF parsing** — architecture, param count, quant extracted correctly from real header bytes
- **Chat template detection** — 20+ real-world model names map to correct families

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Before you open a PR:

1. **Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md)** — the engineering principles are non-negotiable.
2. **Read [`docs/process.md#workflow`](./docs/process.md#workflow)** — the one-step-at-a-time loop.
3. **Read [`docs/process.md#conventions`](./docs/process.md#conventions)** — naming, commits, branches.
4. **Keep each file single-concern.** Split by responsibility when it starts doing two things — not by a line count.
5. **Tests pass AND outputs are verified.** A green CI run is necessary, not sufficient.

### Branch naming
`phase-N/feature-name` — e.g. `phase-2/persistent-settings`.

### Pull request checklist
- [ ] Single concern (one feature, one bug, one refactor)
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Output verified — actually look at what the code produced
- [ ] Docs in `docs/` updated in the same PR
- [ ] Each file stays single-concern (split by responsibility, not line count)
- [ ] No `unwrap()` outside tests
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits

## Security & privacy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> QuantaMind is local-first by design.

| Guarantee | How it's enforced |
|---|---|
| **No telemetry** | No analytics SDK; no crash reporting service; no tracking pixels |
| **No account required** | App runs offline once a model is installed |
| **Network calls limited to** | Local model servers (`http://localhost:11434` Ollama, `127.0.0.1:8093` whisper.cpp STT, the dynamic llama/MLX ports) and `https://huggingface.co` (only when you actively browse/install/download) |
| **Speech-to-text is offline-only** | Transcription uses a loopback-only probe — it never reaches the cloud; a down local STT server fails loud rather than silently falling back |
| **No silent shell edits** | Changing `OLLAMA_MODELS` *generates* the export command for you; never edits your shell profile |
| **Tauri sandboxing** | Capabilities declared in `backend/capabilities/`; webview can only call IPC commands explicitly registered |
| **Schema validation at every IPC boundary** | Zod on TS side, serde + `validator` on Rust side; malformed payloads rejected with typed errors |
| **No `unwrap()` in production paths** | Clippy `deny(unwrap_used)` enforced in critical files; mutex-poison paths recover instead of panicking |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is QuantaMind a chat app?</b></summary>

No. QuantaMind is a workbench. Each Workspace run is a single prompt → single completion (run history is available via the History panel). The multi-step **agentic** loops live in the Eval engine, not a chat UI — if you want a chat front-end on top of Ollama, look elsewhere.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does QuantaMind fine-tune or train models?</b></summary>

No. QuantaMind consumes pre-trained models. Training is out of scope.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does speech-to-text work, and does my audio leave the machine?</b></summary>

Speech-to-text runs entirely locally on **whisper.cpp** (`whisper-server`), a sidecar on `127.0.0.1:8093` — its own engine axis, parallel to the LLM backend. Install it once with `brew install whisper-cpp` and download a model under **Models → Speech-to-Text**. Your audio is decoded and resampled in Rust and sent only to the local server; a loopback-only probe means it never reaches the cloud, and a down server fails loud instead of silently falling back. You can pipe the transcript straight into the selected LLM (optionally automatically) for a full voice → assistant loop.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why Ollama and not llama.cpp directly?</b></summary>

Ollama gives us a clean HTTP API, a stable model storage convention, and handles a lot of platform-specific GPU plumbing. It's no longer the only backend, though: a llama.cpp (`llama-server`) adapter and an MLX (`mlx_lm`, Apple Silicon) adapter now ship alongside it, all behind a single `InferenceBackend` trait.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why keep files single-concern?</b></summary>

Long files hide their dependencies, smuggle in second concerns, and make every reviewer scroll. We split by responsibility — when a file starts doing two things — rather than enforce an arbitrary line count.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I run QuantaMind without an internet connection?</b></summary>

Yes, once you've installed at least one model. The Workspace, Voice (Speech-to-Text), and Compare tabs are fully offline. Only the Hugging Face tab — and downloading new LLM or whisper models — needs connectivity.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What happens to my prompts?</b></summary>

They live in memory until you save them. Save creates a YAML file at the path you choose. No cloud sync. No backup. You own them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I uninstall a model?</b></summary>

Open the Add Model modal → Storage tab → Uninstall on the row → confirm. The model is removed from Ollama and every list in the app refreshes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does QuantaMind send any usage data?</b></summary>

None. The only outbound HTTP is to your local Ollama and (when you ask) to Hugging Face.
